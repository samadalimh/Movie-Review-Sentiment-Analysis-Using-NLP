The one thing that occurred to me after watching this drivel was i would never get the time I used to watch this back again If you want to see Stacey keach and Michael dorn try and earn what must have been then the down payments on a holiday home then stay tuned Wooden acting poor special effects the only comedic highlight was whilst our alien hero was in female form and this is over as soon as she has done her obligatory bmovie nude sex scene within 30 mins into the movie The opportunity to have made what could have been a decent movie disappears the moment Nicole Eggbert clocks the alien in a bar within 30 seconds whilst the Police Military and Joe public dont cotton on that the woman drinking coffee dosnt use the cup handle and wears four jumpers at once She must obviously be from another planet Just where I wish I was when this movie was on,0
I have been a fan of Without A Trace from the premier episode I really cannot express my disappointment in the episode last week This is a REAL problem that far too many AficanAmerican families have dealt with and continue to deal with The lack of media coverage crucial in the first 48 hours has been documented by a recent study Law enforcement including local state and federal are also complicit What was the purpose of advertising this subject matter and then copping out on the ending Seemingly television can deal with almost ANY subject matter EXCEPT RACE This is shamefulGet it together or dont explore it next time,0

Even if youre a fan of Jean Rollins idiosyncratic body of work you will be caught off guard by this exceptional foray into science fiction territory For once theres not a single diaphanously gowned vampire girl in sight True to tradition the budget proved way too tight to realize the directors vision entirely Yet this is largely compensated by his obvious love of genre cinema dedication to his craft and sheer ingenuity JeanClaude Coutys atmospheric cinematography makes the most of the foreboding locations and Philippe Brjean aka Gary Sandeur contributes a startling soundtrack that fortunately doesnt resemble any of the sappy stuff he composed for hardcoreShot in and around a Paris office block before and after working hours the film was largely cast with porn regulars Rollin was already quite familiar with from his Michel Gentil cashgathering XXX efforts most notably French fck film royalty Brigitte Lahaie in the demanding lead Playing Elisabeth rather well I might add shes picked up wandering a nearby highway one night by Robert Vincent Gardre driving home at the end of a long work day Barely able to piece together the string of events that got her there Elisabeth seems to lose her memories mere moments after events occur even forgetting Roberts name and heroic savior role before their night flight comes to an end at his apartment Prior to making love she rightfully describes herself as a virgin further credit to Brigittes thespian skills that she can handle the line so convincingly being after all one of the more active adult actresses of the 70s because she cannot recall a single touch preceding his Because of this nifty bit of context the relatively long sex scene that follows totally eschews the gratuity of other commercial interludes Rollin has had to include in other works to assure fundingWhen Robert leaves for work hes inevitably erased from Elisabeths feeble mind A mysterious doctor comedian Bernard Papineau effectively cast against type and his menacing assistant Solange striking porn starlet Rachel Mhas move in on her during her protectors absence and take her back to the place she turns out to have escaped from Here we get one of the movies strongest scenes as shes reintroduced to her roommate Catherine the late Cathrine Greiner aka hardcore performer Cathy Stewart in a quietly devastating turn both girls desperately supplying fictitious shared memories for one another in a bid to outrun their inevitable fate That deterioration is not solely limited to the mind becomes painfully clear when they are served lunch and Catherines unable to control her movements in trying to eat a spoonful of soup Its also Catherine who gets to voice the filmmakers compromise with the demands of commerce as she urges Elisabeth to get naked and hold her because sex is all they have left now that both mind and physical faculties have deserted themSeveral rather explicit if not quite hardcore sex scenes make up the movies midsection and French porn aficionados should recognize the likes of Alain Plumey aka Cyril Val Jacques Gateau and Elodie Delage along with a blink and miss bit from future porno princess Marilyn Jess whose rape at the hands mouth and member of Plumey was only present in the films rarely screened XXX version FILLES TRAQUEES The pivotal part of Vronique a girl Elisabeth almost seems to remember and whom she seeks to escape anew with is beautifully handled by the exquisite Dominique Journet in her unforgettable debut who would go on to play a sizable supporting role in Franco Zeffirellis LA TRAVIATA The six feet under ending reveals the deteriorating condition to be the result of a nuclear spill the quarantined patients ultimately leaving a barely breathing empty shell unceremoniously disposed off in a fiery furnace The final shot offers a particularly heartbreaking variation on that of Chaplins MODERN TIMES as Elisabeth approaching complete meltdown by now and a wounded Robert stumble along the railroad bridge clumsily clasping each others outstretched hands,1
Brand Hauser John Cusack is an assassin for the CIA He is ordered to go to the country of Turaquistan a nation that the United States has liberated and kill a businessman named Omar Shariff This is because the American conglomerate Tamerlane that is putting the country back together will not stand for Shariff an oil man from a neighboring state laying down his own pipeline through wartorn Turquistan But once there Brand runs into difficulties One he meets a determined journalist Natalie Marisa Tomei who wants to tell the American public the true story of the regions conflictand of Tamerlane But Brand is aghast to realize that Natalies pretty face and sharp mind instantly and unconsciously compels him to lose focus on his mission Also his cover as a trade show host forces him to meet the countrys popsinging princess Yonica Hillary Duff who will be getting married at the convention center She is a young diva whose wedding arrangements also turn Brands attention away from the coming assassination With other inept underlings and complications will Brand be able to carry out his mission for the satisfaction of Tamerlanes BIG boss the former vicepresident Dan Ackroyd Good for you John Cusack to make this film even though it doesnt quite hold together Shot in Serbia it is a worthy look at what presentday Iraq must be like a country turned upsidedown In a stroke a brilliance the green zone here is called The Emerald City and aptly so for this Ozlike neighborhood attempts to keep out the ravages of war going on elsewhere in the metropolis The cast is very fine with Cusack doing a nice job and Tomei Joan Cusack Ben Kingsley Ackroyd and others backing him up in style Duff especially does a great turn as the heavilyaccented heavily madeup pottymouthed singer The recreation of warriddled Baghdad is so real that it hurts while the costumes and other production values are topnotch As for the script it isnt always cohesive but it certainly has some tremendous dialogue and scenes For example a young Turaqui boy offers to show Brand an enemy hideout in exchange for money and candy Brand produces the cash but because he has no candy the boy burns his vehicle anyway Brilliant Then also the direction is not a total success but doesnt lag very often No if you have conservative leanings you probably wont like this film one bit But if you have an open mind and want to see a satirical view of the war on terrorism this is quite a good show Therefore do make an effort to view it as you will be supporting those filmmakers who choose to make movies far away from those old studio formulas,1
You probably all already know this by now but 5 additional episodes never aired can be viewed on ABCcom Ive watched a lot of television over the years and this is possibly my favorite show ever Its a crime that this beautifully written and acted show was canceled The actors that played Laura Whit Carlos Mae Damian Anya and omg Steven Caseman are all incredible and so natural in those roles Even the kids are great Wonderful show So sad that its gone Of course I wonder about the reasons it was canceled There is no way Ill let myself believe that Ms Moynahans pregnancy had anything to do with it It was in the perfect time slot in this market Ive watched all the episodes again on ABCcom I hope they all come out on DVD some day Thanks for reading,1
Oh brotherafter hearing about this ridiculous film for umpteen years all I can think of is that old Peggy Lee songIs that all there is I was just an early teen when this smoked fish hit the US I was too young to get in the theater although I did manage to sneak into Goodbye Columbus Then a screening at a local film museum beckoned Finally I could see this film except now I was as old as my parents were when they schlepped to see itThe ONLY reason this film was not condemned to the anonymous sands of time was because of the obscenity case sparked by its US release MILLIONS of people flocked to this stinker thinking they were going to see a sex filmInstead they got lots of closeups of gnarly repulsive Swedes onstreet interviews in bland shopping malls asinie political pretensionand feeble whocares simulated sex scenes with saggy pale actorsCultural icon holy grail historic artifactwhatever this thing was shred it burn it then stuff the ashes in a lead boxElite esthetes still scrape to find value in its boring pseudo revolutionary political spewingsBut if it werent for the censorship scandal it would have been ignored then forgottenInstead the I Am Blank Blank rhythymed title was repeated endlessly for years as a titilation for porno films I am Curious Lavender for gay films I Am Curious Black for blaxploitation films etc and every ten years or so the thing rises from the dead to be viewed by a new generation of suckers who want to see that naughty sex film that revolutionized the film industryYeesh avoid like the plagueOr if you MUST see it rent the video and fast forward to the dirty parts just to get it over with,0
This move is terrible They took Gods word and made a mockery of it The acting was terrible too Why bother doing a story on something from the bible when your not even going to tell it correctly There were not just a few changes but the whole thing was wrong Do not see this movie,0
I rented this because Im a bit weary of 80s NBC programming and apparently I saved myself a lot of money I have nothing against any of the actors and for their credit they do a good job but this show is flawed from the premiseWe have a character who is unlikable Hes full of flaws not enlightened and a complete jerk on a good day Yet the reason why anybody should care just isnt there While creating an American sitcom centered around a complete bullheaded jackass is revolutionary and full of potential it just isnt met here within this show Most of the supporting characters arent fully fleshed characters but rather sad punching bags that want empathy from the audience for being punching bags As in any sitcom they are the ones who are made the most normal for the audience to relate to and in doing this they negate the lead character to such an extent that we see Bittinger being himself and harming people and they just stay there becausewhy There is no reason Any normal people would have simply left the abuse Keeping them there without any real reasoneven the really unbelievable one given by Joanna Cassidy in the very special 2part abortion episode that has major problems of its ownis where the show just falls apart To simply believe that people put up with this guy because we are told he has a heart of gold does not mesh with the reality of the situation If anything this isnt even dramedy This is a badly plotted conceived and executed premise that had a few moments but overall met the fate it deserved Someone had the guts to go out and make a very good idea but the execution is so haphazard that it just looks like a weirdly scripted version of the Jerry Springer show where someone is abused by this tyrant that were supposed to root for because we are told to A show like this requires a deft touch that the actors here could have provided easily but somehow arent able to And thats a fatal error that really killed the programChalk it up to a show in its infancy Regardless the show is worth a watch But it really screwed up when trying to aim for the stars and made the whole enterprise not what it could have been,0
Very few so called remakes can be as good as the originals This one crosses that border with flying colors Just a remake I dont think so I saw it theatrically at the age of nine and was completely entranced and enraptured by the film The film certainly invites comparisons to its 1963 counterpart The earlier film is also a enjoyable and entertaining movie but admittedly it tends to feel more like a nature documentary than a film This update is more epic and cinematic Still I thoroughly recommend both filmsThis film is certainly a mustsee for an animal lover We have the wise old Golden Retriever Shadow the sharp sarcastic Himalayan cat Sassy and the young funloving American Bulldog Chance The animals are brilliantly voiced by Don Ameche Sally Field and Michael J Fox respectivelyThere is virtually nothing offensive in the film There is a bit of scatological humor but nothing extreme No hard violence save a few tense scenes involving a pounding waterfall an angry porcupine and a dark railroad shaftHilarious scary moving and above all real it surprised me to see that this film didnt win any awards not one Nevertheless I will have to say this is just as good as some of the Best Picture nominees nowadays,1
Freddys Dead The Final Nightmare the sixth installment of the Nightmare on Elm Street series and once again another bad sequel I think this is tied up with the last sequel of the Dream Child I was lucky enough to get the Nightmare on Elm Street series box DVD set for my birthday so I got to see all the sequels May I say that Im just getting more and more disappointed though with these sequels at least the past two it just seems like Freddy lost his edge Its almost like the writers were trying to give Freddy a soul and theyre just destroying it instead of reinventing the story This was a sequel that wasnt needed sorry to Robert Englund but this was very much below what Freddy Krueger representsFreddy is back but hes got something we dont know about a daughter Maggie shes not aware that he is her father but soon she finds out what his dark secrets are and he wants her help She has to do her best to resist his powers but its hard with all the good memories she has of her loving father Ironic isnt it But Freddy isnt giving up without manipulating her into his waysFreddys Dead The Final Nightmare is also presented in 3D radical huh Note the sarcasm This is one of the worst sequels its tied up with the fifth sequel of the Nightmare on Elm Street series Id rather watch the second Nightmare on Elm Street to be honest This just had bad acting stupid editing and just over all a bad idea for a story I didnt like the concept of it and it just ruined the whole idea of who Freddy Krueger really is the death master of nightmares not Father Knows Best210,0
I love the way he experiments Ab Tak Chappan was a thrill to watch just as much Satya and company was Jatin the new comer also lived up to his role and Nana Patekar was at his best Suchak was really irritating but I think he fit the character he was playing he had really ugly teeth The story has a great progress and no songs in the movie makes it better I only wish he signs up Urmila for his other up coming movies I think they are the best director and actress combination I have seen I have not seen Naach as yet but I am looking forward for it I for some reason dont find Antra Maali that exciting to watch on the screen unlike Urmila,1
Maybe James P Lay knows what do to in the sound department if a director supervises himIn Dreamland 2007 however he cannot accomplish anything as a writer or as a directorThere is absolutely nothing in this film no story no character building no events no atmosphere no plot no twists no acting that deserves that nameIn any of those departments this movie is billions of light years behind any short film that has some actual thinking in it even a one minute oneIt has nothing to do with any of David Lynchs worksI actually think it could be used as mental torture or as negative propaganda material against the WestRecommend it only to your worst enemies,0
Classic highly influential low budget thriller that gave birth to a horror icon and launched the careers of both director Carpenter and star CurtisSeemingly unstoppable murderer escapes from mental institution and returns to his hometown where he begins to stalk a local babysitter on HalloweenHalloween is a film that never fails to live up to its reputation as a horror masterpiece Carpenters frightening story and clever direction give this film such chillingly good life that it must be seen to really be felt The direction often consists of such simple elements shadows dark streets creaking doors that it makes even the everyday setting of a small town neighborhood truly creepy Carpenter welltimes his suspense and his jolting shocks to make them the most effectively startling that in itself is a feat few horror filmmakers ever manage Plus he is wise enough to give us some truly likable young characters and a very scary villain to keep the tension all the more strong Highest kudos also go to Carpenters simple yet frighteningly unnerving music score In a sense Halloween is a fine example of a perfect horror filmThe cast is excellent Young Jamie Lee Curtis does a very nice turn as lovable babysitter Laurie Strode shes so good that she would go on to be in a number of other horror films before breaking into bigger films The great Donald Pleasants does a perfect performance as a Myers doctor whos desperate to capture him again Supporting cast Loomis Soles Castle and others are good tooSo like its own villain Halloween is an unstoppable force that never fails to thrill and chill It is a MUST for all genre fans out of,1
We so often talk of cinema landmarks Kane The Godfather A Bout de Souffle One film however is too often overlooked by serious film critics I am talking of course about the classic Doc Savage MoBThis film is not only exciting but also seriously explores the issue of exploitation of the developing nations by US imperialism Not to mention kungfuIt also possessed the greatest soundtrack in film history until of course Queens breathtaking work on Flash Gordon Although a bit of a rarity this film is well worth seeking out it will repay the effort of your search tenfold,1
Yes this is one of the greats of the black action genre Confusing mixture of racist comedy and racist violence at times reaching a disturbing pitch even for a fan of the genre this movie isnt your Shaft in the park Wonderful bits of Rudy Ray Moore comedy stand up that dont seem funny at least not to a white boy like me but great in context Much better than its dissimilar sequel The Human Tornado,1
Yes nonSingaporeans cant see whats the big deal about this film Some of the references in this film fly right over the head of foreign viewers and mostly Singaporeans are the ones who would actually get it But i plead with you foreigner look at the other crap thats been churned out from Singapore and compare it to this film Its like comparing a mules diarhhoea chunks to a little diamond This film is the first to truly show some the singapores seedy underbelly something the forces that be pretend does not exist And theres a part in the film where a gangsterahbeng in our unique colloquial ingris curses in 4 languages namely Tamil English Malay and Hokkien Well the truth is most of us can and do do that all the time The sad thing is that viewers from foreign contries will have an easier time getting their oily little claws on this gem in its country of origin it was banned initially only to be given and Rrating and that too with about 20 cuts to it Its nice to know you that one of the best creative edgy and original films ever created would be easier for you to obtain unadulterated uncensored halfway across the world than in your own nation,1
The novel WEAPON which serves as the basis for this atrocious piece of garbage is one of the best technothrillers to come down the pike in a long timeThe character of SOLO who is NOT supposed to look like a human is a wonderful creation and it was simply awful to see him reduced to just another Terminatorclone with Mario Van Peebles horrendously trying to act like a robot There is NOTHING worthwhile about this filmWhy does Hollywood insist on snapping up the rights to excellent novels and then butchering them There are so many things wrong with SOLO that listing them seems as unfair as inviting a man with no legs to a brisk game of Hopscotch Avoid this awful film and seek out the 2 novels by ROBERT MASON that feature the awesome character of SOLO The books are WEAPON and an excellent sequel SOLOBut dont pay any attention to this awful dreck of a film,0

Since the past couple of days Im really hooked on the Female Scorpion series and I keep hitting myself over the head because I waited until now which is way too long before purchasing the whole box set Beast Stable is the third brilliant effort in a row and the undeniably main trump of this series is how the writers always came up with something entirely new and different for each installment Never before or after has there been an exploitation series that offered so much variety when it comes to story lines settings themes and filming styles The original more or less qualified as a socalled WomeninPrison flick but already an atypical one but you cant possibly categorize parts 2 and 3 as such since they hardly feature any footage within prison walls And the overall tone and atmosphere keeps changing with each new episode as well The first film was harsh and gritty whereas the second was psychedelic and part three is almost mainly melodramatic Dont let this last description discourage you however as Beast Stable still features more than enough exploitative themes and disturbing footage in spite of the dramatic ambiance The opening sequence for example is downright fantastic Sasori still a fugitive from the law literally chops her way to freedom on the subway when theres no other possibility than to cut off the arm of the persistent policeman that handcuffed her Her run through the city with the cutoff arm dangling on hers while the credits appear on screen accompanied by the familiar theme song is just pure and genuine exploitation gold The story compellingly continues with our heroine desperately trying to lead an anonymous life in the big city but the poor thing simply cant escape her past or even new types of agony Sasori befriends a prostitute though without exchanging dialog and takes on a job in a sewing atelier Her own retarded brother impregnates the prostitute while Sasori gets in trouble with the local pimping and underground crime network She cleverly prevents a thug from taking advantage of her body encounters a former enemy from prison and furiously avenges one of the prostitutes when she gets submitted to a barbaric abortion Meanwhile the onearmed cop continues to obsessively prowl the streets looking for retribution against Sasori Our multitalented director Shunya Ito formidably crisscrosses all these story lines to a powerful wholesome and never once loses grip on the visual aspects or ingenious filming style Beast Stable features some of the most impressive compositions and ingenious camera angles you can imagine the editing is flawless and the exterior locations are effectively depressing Those who know Sasoris character a bit are aware that the film seriously lacks memorable dialogs but this always gets widely compensated with Meiko Kajis wondrous on screen charisma and menacing grimaces Theres very little sleaze apart from the aforementioned incestuous sub plot but the brief flashes of extreme violence are terrific and the twisted ending is almost too brilliant for words In fact I think part three might just be the greatest or at least my favorite one of the series so far My only small and totally irrelevant point of criticism is regarding the ridiculous sounds one of the birds produces when Sasori is locked up in a cage That bird sounds like a ventriloquists dummy with stomach cramps,1
This movie is masterly directed by Clive barker he really knows how to establish a rapport between the audience and the characters I think there is a sequel missing for this one Barker should have dedicated to the sequel for this movie instead of doing the boring Lord of illusions that is one I think was a real garbage But I also think that because of this and because of the lack of the sequel NBreed has become a dark cult classic of horror films,1
What can you say about a short little film filled with secondary actors and no stars with absolutely no bad performances not one poorly delivered line of dialog and with the cold violence on one hand being balanced by the warm heart of the protagonists in the story Its a jewel a diamond a little valuable gem of a western that evokes the spirit and legend of the American West A West not settled by grand heroes like Hickock or Cody or Masterson or Earp but by the spread of the everyday man and woman farmers and ranch hands merchants and miners and lumbermen whores and barkeeps and entertainers of the day some looking for riches some for peace and quiet some for religious freedom It is perhaps a very spiritual story though not promoting any particular religion for even the nonMormon cowboys portrayed by Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr act in kind and noble ways toward everybody in the story regardless of religious affiliation and beliefs and go out of their way to promote tolerance and charity when the wagon train comes upon the stranded medicine show people And in true biblical fashion like David and Goliath or Samson and the Philistines they are the guardian angels sent to the wagon train who eventually have to go head to head with the evil incarnate Clegg clan likening them to the serpent in the Garden of Eden and regretting what it is they have to do afterward Its a sweet folkloric tale of the West that hits every target John Ford takes aim atNowadays I have a western Santa Claus whose red outfit is covered with a denim drover coat whose red stocking cap is replaced by a brown Stetson who carries a burlap bag of presents and a coil of rope To my Santa I added a Winchester rifle with a sling to put on one of his shoulders and a Colt revolver to tuck into his waistband When people at the office ask why my Santa has to carry guns I simply reply Snakes After all isnt the spirit of the Christmas season one where everybody should get what they deserve Fifty five years later especially post911 the philosophies and attributes demonstrated by the characters and story of this movie are still as relevant today as they were back then,1
I think part of the reason this movie was madeand is aimed at us gamers who actually play all the Nancy Drew PC games Theres been a lot of movies lately based on video games and I think this in one of themSo this movie does not follow any book But it does follow parts of the games I buy and play every Nancy Drew games as soon as it comes out And the games are from HerInteractive and are for girls who arent afraid of a mouse And some of these games actually won Parents Choice Gold Awards They are not only fun but you can actually learn a thing or two while playingI took two of my step children with me to go see it and they loved it The 10 yr old had started playing her first Nancy Drew game a day before I took her to see the movie and she was having so much fun playing the game I thought she would enjoy the movie as well And I was rightshe not only loved this movie but couldnt wait to get home to finish her first game and start another oneMy other step daughter is only 7 and she also loved the movie but she is still a little to young too play the games yet but she enjoys watching her sister play at times just to see whats going onThe games are based for children 10 yrs and older All the games usually get pretty descent reviews and are classified as adventure games For more information on the games just check out HerInterative Nancy Drew games So personally I thought the movie was pretty good and I will buy it when it comes out on DVD,1
Definitely not worth the rental but if you catch it on cable youll be pleasantly surprised by the cameosImans appearance is especially selfdeprecating Its also an opportunity to watch all the male supporting cast members from The Sopranos typecast themselves,0
I really wanted to like this film however after an amusing opening few minutes I hardly cracked a smile I agree there was no chemistry at all between the two leads and the other characters were cliche ridden The script totally wasted the talents of Bud Tingwell and Kim GyngellIt must be said however that there was plenty of laughter around me and even a smattering of applause at the end Perhaps I just couldnt relate to it enough Im just glad I went on cheap tickets,0
The ELITE sniper team that has inserted 24h or so earlier have instead of digging in and making them selves invisible decided to take cover behind a big rock in one of the first scenes When the hero runs to rescue his wife he actually jogs When inside a building and aiming for a target only some 2030 meter away the hero USES HIS SCOPE Besides the fact that most non elite soldiers would make that shot from the hip and still hit there is also the fact that the scope probably wouldnt be able to focus that close There is a satellite that can actually look horizontally into buildingsThe list is endless and the film is the biggest heap of crap I have ever put in my DVD player,0
I really tried to like this movie It deals with an important problem in any society sex addictionIn this story we learn that you can lose everything when youre addicted to sex In this case our main character and hero for having nonstop sex with all kinds of women crazy kinky neurotic puts in jeopardy his marriage job and even his lifeThe production values are terrible mainly the acting Oh you wont enjoy ANY of the sex scenes most of them are done in very poor taste and you might think youre watching a home made flickSecond the plot is just non sense How could such a smart and beautiful wife stand all the nasty stuff from the husband How could she believe him The threesome situation is priceless and will make you chuckle for a whileAlso the scene with the black movie theater attendant is just pointless and will leave you thinking wtf Scenes like those you will find plenty Avoid this movie Please avoid it its not soft core its not a documental its not a dramatic feature Its a pretentious effort form a so called documentary director or whateverOnly Mrs Kinskis legs on display are worth the watch I caught it on HBO and Im glad I didnt spend my money on it But those 90 minutes of my life wont come back,0
As a true lover of film I must advise you to avoid this appalling effort God knows how funding was approved Seriously this is one cinematic experience which delivers zero dramatic tension and plods along until nothing happens again and again and again The only connectivity is two scares which at least keep you awake Possiby the worst film I have ever witnessed and the acting by the female lead is bordering on criminal intent One blessing with modern technology you can fast forward and watch it on 12x and it will only last 25 minutes And you wont miss any of the plotNo idea how people find this at all interesting and some are giving it high marks,0
Weak scripts at times Yep Cheesy special effects at times Yep Deliciously guilty pleasure most of the time Yep More about Carl Kolchak and Darren McGavin Yep I always enjoyed science fiction as a kid but found so much of the DraculaFrankensteinMummyhorror stuff as just so much crap It took Abbott and Costello to give me a new perspective on the classic Universal monsters and it took Carl Kolchak to win me over to the dark side of entertainment The Duke had Rooster Cogburn Eastwood had Dirty Harry Garner had Maverick and Rockford Selleck had Magnum and Darren McGavin had Carl Kolchak Mixed in with all those weak scripts cheesy special effects that baroque group of supporting characters and actors and guest stars there was Darren McGavin as Carl Kolchak He had a wry sense of humor in spite of the danger was an idealist in his pursuit of the truth and a realist when it came to accepting the obligatory incompetence and eventual coverup by government officials Additionally unlike 98 of us Kolchak was willing to stick his neck out and do what needed to be done even if it meant his demise the end of his journalistic career or jail time For all his faults including no taste in clothes Carl Kolchak was a man of charm and wit who drove a beautiful classic yellow Mustang which was an old used car at the time on his way to save the day for humanity As good as any other fictional hero Carl Kolchak was the everyman hero brought to life every week for one season thanks to Darren McGavin Now that hes passed on and his show is on DVD I hope hes having as much fun watching me watch him have fun playing Kolchak The Night Stalker all over again,1
I absolutely love this movie Evil Dead has NOTHING on this film Night of the Demons 2 and 3 are a total bore fest but this one is a classic Its super cheesy and the acting is alright at best but what more could you want from an 80s horror movie Stooge has some of the best oneliners to ever hit the screen in this one hes my favorite character A lot of people talk about the lipstick scene in this movie but my personal favorite is the ending sadly enough has nothing to do with the main characters when the old man eats his left over Halloween apples in a pie and his throat is mangled from the inside out The sound track is awesome The scene with Angela dancing is totally creepy especially after the strobe light comes on and you can see her jump from one part of the floor to the next with every sound of a camera shutter click on the song thats playing The makeup effects in this movie are pretty sweet Angela gave me nightmares as a kid If youre the type of person who demands perfection out of your filming experience you might want to give this one a pass But if youre like me and you really dig the whole Halloween haunted house with the demons clich than this one is definitely a must own,1
Well Id have to say that I do own this film and I only like the ending The movie is boring and slow but the final fight is so funny Lets just say that if the fake bird didnt attack the main evil guy this movie would be a 0 out of 10 The bird though makes it a 3 If you are truly bored or want something terrible to watch rent this and fast forward to the final battle,0
I watched the version with pathetic American overdubs maybe this made it much worse but from what I could make out the film was pretty bad anyway It seemed low budget The visuals reminded me of a second rate TV movie random white dog substituted for Dogmatix embarrassing 60s BBC costumes etc Mainly though I feel like the characters in the movie did not behave anything like the characters in the comic and as a result I never felt willing to even try to forgive the poor look of the film It is always going to be hard to capture the feel of the comics in a film without using animation and I didnt feel this attempt was worth it ultimately,0
Unfortunately there was not a 0 for a rating or else I wouldve chosen it This movie lacks the star power that the original movie had in such abundance Carol Burnett Albert Finney Tim Curry Bernadette Peters Edward Hermann the innocence of newcomer Aileen Quinn and expert directing from seasoned pro John Huston father of actress Angelica Hustonis what made this film so charming Even the 1999 remake with Kathy Bates Victor Garber Alan Cumming and Kristin Chenoweth had more to offer than this sorry excuse for a sequel Before she did this movie all Ashley Johnson was known for was her role as little Chrissie Seaver on the prime time show Growing Pains She had a few bit parts in movies but I dont know who thought she had talent enough to carry a movie on her own And adding Joan Collins as Lady Edwina Hogbottom ridiculous They couldnt get good enough actors to play the major roles like Daddy Warbucks Miss Hannigan and Annie but they will sign Joan Collins to play some British lady It doesnt surprise me that this movie was as bad as it was The critics were right to have not agreed with this movie even if it was only made for TV it was a poor sequel to an otherwise lovable movie,0
Just plain good old stupid I mean really stupid not the good stupid like Killer Tomatoes or Ed Wood movies this is probably the most stupid movie I ever have seen To give this movie an golden Turkey is an insult to turkeys To call this movie dumb is offensive even to dumb peopleIf this is the future of American cinema and art we are better off to really start world war 3 and 4 at the same time and let the cockroaches run the show after Now I have to get drunk to wash this insult to my single braincell offThis is a really good movie if you are suicidal,0
How to summarize this film it is simply impossible Why you should see it maybe for the story very probably for the actors Giorgio Catherine above all for the universe and the poetry This is a tale Sad sometimes dark but a tale I LOVE this film Just waiting for the DVD Thank you mister Boutonnat,1
I have watched two episodes so far I really like it Even though I am no longer in college it makes me miss the wonderful college life I wish that I spent a little more time socializing I kind of identify myself with rusty When I was rushing a fraternity my big brother was not like Cappie at all I wish that I had a big brother like him So if a show like this can actually make people to identify themselves with the characters then it is a pretty good showIt is more realistic than American pie with less explicit sex jokes Can we also call this a younger version of desperate wives some of the writers must be Greeks themselves the story seems to reflect somewhat of the real fraternity and sorority life It was shot in high definition And they actually filmed outside instead of inside of studios so the picture quality is very good They could easily make this a good film Unlike a movie which can only last a few hours I can have about 45 minutes of fun watching it free on TV weeklyThe casting is excellent the actors are about the right age and they are new and fresh so that makes them more real This show practically is about everyone There are Asian and black frat boys and sorority girls in the show as well It is almost a little shocking that they had a little story about two guys in the fraternity had sex in first episode then tried to hook up again in the second episode I dont think that I have seen anything like this on TV before This show somehow reminded me about a Warner bros TV show of teenagers called Young Americans which got canceled in early 2001 In that show a girl who dressed like a man kissed a guy and that guy thought that she was a male homosexualGreek life can be fun but on the same time students have to study for exams etc by the time when people actually have some free time in their lives There is no fraternity of sorority for them to join any more I dont know how long this show will last sooner or later those people will have to graduate college too Maybe they will find some new actors for another 4 years of fun college life,1
Who is Bettie Page I certainly didnt find out while watching this movie From what I have gathered from other sources Ms Page was highly in demand in the postworld war II period as the queen of naughty pictures and that is exactly what this film depicts I never did get to know Bettie the woman though Her childhood in Tennessee was a combination of an Evangelical Christian upbringing and a sordid home life which is only hinted at The film glosses over her personal life and gets right down to the purpose of the film the naughty pictures Characters are introduced and abandoned within a few frames but there is frame after frame of Bettie in her pointy bras Bettie in her girdle and stockings Bettie in bondageetc The movie slides from black and white to color every time Ms Page visits Miami Beach Then back to her shades of gray life in New York we go Gretchen Mol portrays Bettie as one of the most dimwitted young ladies you could ever meet When Bettie confides to a friend that she missed being her High School valedictorian by getting an A rather than an A one can only assume that there were only two students in her Senior class The most interesting part of this movie is how quaint Ms Pages naughty photos seem in 2007 It is truly sad that seeing a woman trussed up like a pig on a spit wouldnt even get a hit on My Space or You Tube Im not sure if this movie was written poorly or if some crazed editor cut the thing to shreds I would only recommend it as a source for persons studying the history of odd undergarments,0
Steven Seagal played in many action movies Most of them were bad but not bad as The Patriot This one is a Zseries action lowbudget movie After Operation Delta Force Act of War The Substitute 2 Platos Run The Base Drive Sabotage etc comes The Patriot Now Steven Seagal is sure to be considered as a bad actor like Mark Dacascos JeanClaude Van Damme Treat Williams Jack Scalia Gary Busey Chuck Norris Michael Madsen and many others The scenario was full of holes and the characters were not realistic maybe because of the very bad actors and the 425 bucks you spend by renting The Patriot are called Lost Money I give it 0and a half for laughs out of 5,0
Good story Good script Good casting Good acting Good directing Good art direction Good photography Good sound Good editing Good everything Put it all together and you end up with good entertainmentThe shame of it is that there arent nearly enough films of this caliber being made these days We may count ourselves lucky that writersdirectors like John Hughes are occasionally able to make their creative voices heardWhenever I notice that Im watching a film for the third or fourth time and still find it thoroughly satisfying I have to conclude that something about that film is right,1
This film was on last week and although at that time of the day around 6pm the quality of the movies is almost never good at least here on Mexican TV I couldnt switch the TV off The story about Madelene Moore really touches you She doesnt come across as a very sympathetic character at first but seeing the whole film you just want her so succeed This film really leaves you thinking And i think that basically due to the great acting of Brooke Johnson I had never heard of her before nor knowingly seen her in another film but this was great great acting Compliments to Brooke I hope to see her in another film soon,1
This is a hilarious film Burt Reynolds is a NASCAR star who signs a sponsorship contract with Ned Beattys Chicken Pit restaurants The contract has all sorts of humiliating clauses in it such as forcing Burt to wear a chicken suit during the race Jim Nabors is his not quite convincing chief mechanic Loni Anderson oh yeah is assigned by Beatty to keep Reynolds honest and strictly adhering to the contract This is a funny film in which Burt proves that he aint too proud I like it,1
Soldier Blue is a movie with pretensions pretensions to be some sort of profound statement on mans inhumanity to man on the white mans exploitation of and brutality towards indigenous peoples a biting unflinching and sardonic commentary on the horrors of Vietnam Well sorry but it fails miserably to be any of those things What Soldier Blue actually is is pernicious trite badly made dishonest rubbishAnother reviewer here hit the nail on the head in saying that it appears to be a hybrid of two entirely different movies What it is basically is a lame clichd poorly acted odd couple romance Strauss and Bergen overcoming their prejudices about the others lifestyle and falling in love ah bless bookended by two sickening massacres which wouldnt have been out of place in a Lucio Fulci splatter flickThere is no excuse for the repulsive prurient goredrenched climax in which cute little native American children are variously shot sliced dismembered and impaled in loving and graphic closeup and largebreasted native American women are molested raped and strung up no excuse that is except box office The massacre itself whilst repulsive in its misplaced intention is very badly staged and shot a bunch of actors lying around with bright red paint smeared on them intercut with a few specialeffects sequences of beheadingdismemberment dismemberments incidentally which utilised real amputees in their filming Now thats what I call exploitationForget all the pap youve heard including the ludicrous commentaries that begin and end the movie about this being a protest an indictment of American brutality towards the native peoples This film doesnt give a stuff about the plight of the Cheyenne had it done so it would have featured some involving native American characters would have led us to get to know and to care about the nameless faceless innocents who get slaughtered at the climax Instead what we get is the silly white bread romance of Bergen and Strauss lousy actors both in this at least with plenty of blood guts and severed heads thrown in to attract the curiousWhich is a terrible shame because there is a movie to be made about the Sand Creek massacre about all of the real life massacres the US and Britain and all socalled civilised nations have participated in over the centuries Iraq this just isnt that movie,0
Zombie Chronicles isnt something to shout about its obvious not a award winning movie but it is a entertaining Bmovie directed by Brad Sykes who directed Camp Blood which was another entertaining low budget flick The acting is bad like most cheaply made movies but thats what makes it more entertaining the zombie makeup is cool and effective especially with the budget the gore is also great and gross the film is sort of like a zombie version of Tales from the Crypt since we get two tales about zombie encounters in the woods the stories are fun and do leave you guessing especially the first tale Zombie Chronicles is a lot better than some low budget zombie movies out there if you love low budget Bmovies or cheaply made zombie flicks then check out Zombie Chronicles,1
Madhur Bhandarkar has given it all raw But the best part is he hasnt forgotten to give the ingredients It has come short and crisp to the viewer and it is the audience to make the choice now Page 3 is a revelation of the naked truth irrespective of the crudeness attached to itMadhavi Konkan Sharma is a journalist and enjoys her work A simple and peaceful life adores her with a caring boyfriend and a nice roommate Pearl She covers the Page 3 Celebrity Page of Nation Today where she has a very supportive editor Deepak Suri Boman Irani But life takes turn for her as she hits the first bump and takes herself away from Page 3 and goes into Crime bit Omigosh a whole new world was waiting for her there She is shocked excited stunned with the revelation Her reaction has resulted in losing the job At the end she is back to Page 3 Now when she meets any celebrity in a party she knows the actual looks of each hidden under the illusive faceThe movie has a message and it is crude The audience needs to get it in their own color The theme and the screenplay was fantastic There are some very good thoughts applied to prepare the audiences Like the foreplayclub is shown before the pedophiliac exhibition the short suspense before gayactions in bathroom The dialogs are strong and the actors are really good at delivering it Charu Mohantys 2 words speaks volumes and he is very successful in uttering those two words with such ingenuity it leaves an impact The set selections could have been better The songs dont stand anywhere but they were needed in the background Atul Kulkarni has a small role with highimpact There were a few flaws visible Atul Kulkarni explaining Konkan Sharma that honesty should be tagged along with intelligence There could have been a better dialog as this sounds like a preach The meeting between Thapar and his daughter doesnt call for acting That scene looks very unprofessionalOverall it is a mustwatch movie with selective options before the pedophilia incident That may spoil your mood,1
Hobgoblins is a very cheap and badly done Gremlins ripoff Thats the best thing one can say about this stinkpile Pretty much everyone in the cast was chosen for their looks and not their acting ability It was very painful to watchAvoid this one at all costs,0
This film has its heart in the right place but unfortunately it isnt much of a film It is more of a documentary under the guise of a narrative Bamako is basically a newspaper oped piece put on celluloid However your average wellresearched oped piece is far more cogent and concise than anything presented here The filmmaker is trying to relay to the viewer the hardships of African life in particular the country of Mali due to the unethical practices of the IMF G8 and World Bank by using the setting of a mock trial against the aforementioned There is an extra 10 minutes dispersed throughout the film that makes a halfhearted attempt at a narrative plot and a bizarre Hollywood Westernstyle shootout scene where the director seems quite pleased with his own cleverness hence the frequent Godard comparisonsOf course as the film begins what and who is on trial is never explained but as we know by now the French refuse to spoonfeed their audienceThere are many impassioned arguments made but they are often longwinded delivered in a shrill monotone one that becomes quite easy to tune out after awhile and very light on specifics The last point is the most frustrating of all since there is a very wellreasoned specific case to be made against the institutions on trial here Unfortunately all we get in 2 hours is that the IMF and G8 are evil oppressors and should forgive 3rdWorld debt We are given no more than the occasional hint to the specific reasons why the organizations on trial are guilty but never a clear case The mocktrial arguments and the footage of the surrounding village makes the suffering of these African residents clear but one wonders why we must sit through 2 hours of it when a far more precise picture could be painted in a 20minute Newsweek article or Bill Moyers episode In the end there is something very important to be said on this issue it simply isnt presented very well or very clearly in this pretentious indulgent piece,0
This 1955 heist film follows Tony le Stephanois recently released from prison for theft as he undertakes the robbery of his life He teams up with his old heist buddies and they bring in an expert safecracker Cesar from Milan played by Jules Dassin who also directed He only directed because he had been blacklisted as a communist in the US and couldnt work in Hollywood The brilliance of this film is the 12 hour during the robbery During all this time there is no dialogue and no music only the muted sounds of digging through the floor or drilling the safe This increases the suspense and draws you in They get away with several hundred million francs worth of jewels but a jewel offered to a dancer by Cesar brings their haul to the attention of a trio of brutal brothers They set out to get the stash for themselves and bring misfortune in their wake Great heistgangster movie but I prefer JP Melvilles films in this genreThis movie is like some lemonade I had last night I had gone to a Caribbean restaurant and the lemonade was made with sugar cane juice instead of sugar It also had a lot of ice and was heavy on the lemons leaving it fairly sour which I like The sugar cane juice imparted a subtle slightly more mellow taste to it than actual sugar and the ice made sure it was cold and refreshing as I sucked it down 7510 httpblogmyspacecomlocoformovies,1
I first saw this movie here in the UK in December 1989 when Central TV broadcast it I still have the video tape although worn out over the years many friends and family members have borrowed it and have also been chilled by it Anyway I remember coming home that night grabbing a Christmas tipple switching the lights out and watching what was advertised as a Christmas Ghost Story Even now I remember certain scenes that still send the hairs on my neck standing onend I have seen some comments on the movie which say its not this and not thatI think those people get scared by Friday 13th and the like stalk and slash rammel which are laughable This is a traditional ghost story there is no big budget action or special effectsno swearing no blood no gratuitous sex scenes no chainsaws or guns etcSo how refreshing Its atmospheric IF you like chilling horror well written well acted and with a genuinely scary atmosphere this is the movie for you I like the original horrors only last night I saw the original Haunting and that is a superb movie Very atmospheric again and so is The Woman In Black The end of the movie differs to the book but still very good I recommend it Try ityou will like it if you like traditional ghost storiesSOturn off the lights turn up the fire lock the doors grab a drinkand enjoy,1
I hate to be the one to rain on a parade even a small one like this but from the very first scene you could tell this film was going to be absolute shite Its a shame really as I quite like Martin Freeman and Danny dyer I was intrigued as to how they would mix in a film together but to my dismay they did not even have a scene together I think I need to repeat this The two lead actors who stand side by side on the advertisement posters and DVD covers did not have one scene together They did not speak to each other and never appeared on screen at the same time Just about sums up this poor excuse for a movie False advertisementThe dialogue was painful every single character in the movie was unrealistic and unhuman like The scenarios were far fetched the plot was crap the jokes were thin Freeman tried too hard to be funny and played a poor mans Tim from The office nobody was likable and worst of all some of the characters were so annoying that it almost drove me to switch off as I couldnt bear to watch or listen to them any longerThis low budget stinker was an epic fail Even Danny Dyer couldnt inject some humour and charm into this but bless he tried What a waste of timeHow anybody could rate this movie as ten stars is beyond me Ten Stars Seriously Come onI wont even give some of the greats ten stars as ten stars implies that a movie was perfect This film was far from perfect almost the opposite meaning that it was almost completely dire throughoutWatch it if you like but if youve seen a lot of movies and watched a lot of great movies your review will probably similar to mine110,0
This proved to be a rare case of a poliziottesco made with British funding unfortunately the result is undistinguished except by its exceeding unpleasantness and borderlinecamp approach despite stars and director The former is led by a wooden Franco Nero and an ultrahammy Telly Savalas as a couple of wouldbe robbers if anyone is able to believe either actor who generally exude cool as a duo of bumbling crooks hes more gullible than I amTheir job goes awry ending in murder and saddled with cases of cutlery instead of jewels however the mismatched criminals see an opening to their dilemma when they inadvertently kidnap the son of a British diplomat a miscast Lester who even gets to kick triggerhappy Savalas where it hurts at one point Still they never actually ransom him and their sole intent is to cross the border into France tagging along with them is Neros girlfriend a wasted Ely Galleani soon enough though shes had enough and decides to run away while the others are sleeping the crazy Savalas notices this and following the girl kills her In the meantime Nero and Lester have woken up the former thinks his accomplices may have doublecrossed him so he goes on the lam with the boy in tow after a brief spell at a rich old ladys country estate which features totally gratuitous rear nudes by both Nero and Lester Savalas catches up with them They continue their trek where the trio run into a family of German campers the situation degenerates to the point where Savalas shuts them inside their trailer and tosses the lot into the river though hes badly hurt in the process himself typically it all ends with the heavies getting killed just as theyre about to reach the borderThe film therefore contains most of the genres typical elements sleaze sadism violence chases the aftermath of the opening robbery when the getaway car causes havoc in the citys narrow backstreets and even disrupts a funeral procession is downright farcical etc one mildly interesting aspect to it is that by the end Lester himself is seen to have been definitely irrevocably marked by the experience coming to feel excitement when an act of violence is committed,0
I wanted to love this movie Everything seemed to be in place for an enjoyable if not groundbreaking film It was set in southern France goodlooking and recognizable actors led the cast and I really admired the vibrant African costumes the proverbs and music Despite all this I didnt love it Movies are supposed to convey their meaning at the first viewing but Secret Laughter doesnt do that Nimi and Matthew as played by Long and Firth both of whom have played romantic leads before and should have known better radiate as much warmth and passion as dried fish I used dried fish deliberately because it was one of a few too few strong lines and moments sprinkled throughout the film Another winner was when Nimi catches Matthew snooping around her apartment He finds a book of hers with her first name written on it and says Your name is Nimi I never knew Then he insists that she call him by his Christian name I watched this scene intently as Matthew asked Nimi over and over to say my name realizing that up until that moment they always called each other by their last names I thought this was a turning point for the film and expected that it get better It didnt Why do Nimi and Matthew always seem to stand at ten paces even in that say my name scene What does Matthew like about Nimi aside from her obvious beauty And why would a sensible woman like Nimi fall for a comic book writer who regards his marriage as something he can put on hold when a beautiful exotic adventure comes along And Id like to add that it was a little hard for me to get behind a romance built on adultery Yes Jenny is a vicious harpy but if I were in her shoes but Id probably match her Cruella tactics to stop my husband from straying Believe it The story hints at Nimis painful past but never fully explores it Some critics say Firth seemed a little awkward here and I agree For goodness sake the actor summoned more palpable longing and passion as that early 19thcentury snob Mr Darcy and while wearing those hideous britches As for Long who did shine in Love Jones there were times when she seemed to concentrate more on her accent than playing her character Even so there were many moments the say my name scene among them when she was in total control and came across really well Yet Secret Laughter is not without its redeeming qualities and Ive found that it grew on me with more viewings Nene was well portrayed as supportive and wellmeaning even if she doesnt fully understand Nimis attraction to Matthew I absolutely loved it when Nene faced off with Mama Fola in those dueling proverbs scenes My husband liked it and usually hes the first to sigh and throw insults at the screen if he doesnt like what is going on He even chuckled at the scene when Sammy asked Matthew some very frank questions about sex So there you have it Secret Laughter was good enough to entertain an avowed curmudgeon like my hubby but an avid moviegoer like myself will need more than one viewing to appreciate what the director and writer were trying to convey,1
Magnificent original beautiful movie The acting is great the settings en decors are superb Paris at its best but then the real Paris not the famous settings and the music will do also A brilliant storie very detailed which I just very much loveThe best French movie Ive seen and French cinema is very good,1
Its just when a band tours and only has one original member Its not the same as the classic line up All new actors playing the main roles of Rag Scotty etc with Ashby as virtually the only returning face from the first movie And he was of only minor note of the first flick serving as the only redeemable group of the three guys that Scotty was trying to assist in meeting females The film is poorly written featuring the dumbest dialog this side of Armageddon Even for a TA movie this one is a turkey Not even die hard low budget 80s films fans would want to sit through this movie which has no plot and plenty of bad acting This film would have been better off never being released Just plain bad,0
Like most everyone who views this movie I did it for the stars Michael Madsen and Dennis Hopper The two are extremely underrated and sadly because of that have to headline a lot of crap In this film Hopper plays a guy who accidentally kills a blackmailer and is offered help from the mysterious MadsenThe film actually isnt as terrible as it could have been Ive seen both in much worse both independently and working together LAPD horrible film The direction was pretty poor and the script needed a few rewrites but both give the best performance possible with the material offered Also the ending is pretty strong so you can tell the story had potential But when a glowing review of a film is It could have been much worse it doesnt say much for the film itselfAll in all this is one that can easily be skipped if neither of these actors draw you in But if youre a fan of either or both give it a watch They both give strong performances that outshine the obvious flaws of the film Trust me there are much worse options out there,0
My wife and I watched this abortion from its beginning I hated it immediately but my wife became hooked on it for a couple of yearsFor me it just got worse and worse and the characters were all without question dreary and depressing without any redeeming features My wife then grew tired of it and we stopped watching altogether Occasionally I catch a clip of it or pass through it when channel surfingThere is always someone yelling at someone else or doing something dreadful There never seems to be any lighter moments or happiness of any kind That was always my main gripe with it when we first watched it no humour The writers seem to have no idea about drama they seem to think conflict IS drama and of course that is only one element of it Light and shade is sorely needed and actors who can bring something to it I am sure the actors in Eastenders are competent but they have nothing to work with It must be the most depressing acting job in showbiz I fail to understand why the British public watch it and love it What on earth does it say about our psyche I have heard it said that it is just like real lifeits nothing like my life or anyones life I know otherwise we would be flinging ourselves from high buildings or under public transport The themes it tackles are far from family viewing but still are shown prewatershed I love series like Breaking Bad or The Wire but I would not expect to see them at 730 or 800 in the evening The programme is trash writ large and should be avoided at all cost,0
I try to be diverse in my movie watching I can get into Pride and Prejudice as easily as I get into Disappearing Acts Love Jones is my all time favorite it is the standard by which I judge any Modern Urban Romantic Comedy Shot very well the shot of Nia and Darius riding up Lakeshore Drive on the Motorcycle is one of Classic 3 second movie shots of all time Of course no one will ever remember it When it came out I though it would be a new paradigm for Modern Urban Filmmaking good actors no guns and so forth The movie industry has disappointed me to a certain degree you will have your occasional Drumline or Roll Bounce or Tyler Perrys Why Did I get Married So whenever I need to see my people presented on screen in a very professional and stylish way I pop in Love Jones There is no Best Movie ever made to many people and opinions for that But it is my personal best My favorite line from Love Jones Baby I just wanna come up and talk,1
This movie is specially for children and I think they will enjoy the movie For older than 10 the movie is not great but Hilary Swank played very well and without her the movie is very bad but now it gets a 7,1
How is it in this day and era people are still dumb enough to think that other dumb stuff is smart Maybe dumb people like watching stuff that makes them feel smart Such as The War At Home Cuss its even dumber than the dumb people who watch it There are no jokes only halfjokes and slight gags that barely even warrant a tiny internal smile The acting is your typical unsubtle idiotic standard sitcom flailinglimbs type acting And why oh why did this crap replace arrested development Well you gotta hand it to Fox They know that they need to have stupid shows to attract all the stupid viewers You see the reason Arrested Development wasnt massively popular was because it was so smart It was so smart that it made dumb people feel bad about being so dumb And of course if a dumb person encounters a smart person the dumb person will hate the smart person Most of the time anyway Either that or try and mooch off of the smart person If you like this show and are one of the dumb people I truly cannot fathom what it must be like not to have open eyes and open minds I cannot fathom what it must be like to be mindless laughing drones influenced by every little thing Basically people who laugh with a laugh track are parrots Trained obedient mindless parrots Maybe I shouldnt insult parrots by comparing them to you You know who you are If I seem like a bastar in this review its because Im so annoyed at AD being canceled,0
I saw it last night on TV and was quite delighted It is sort of the movie which makes you feel nice and warm around heart and believe that there is still some goodness in the world all the neighbours pretended not to see what grace was doing in order to help her and protect her the old policeman is my favourite although you know that this story is not quite realisticI loved acting they all seemed just as ordinary common people living in small picturesque English coast town but the greatest thing in the movie was the wit and humor it has Just remember the scene in the shop with two old ladies after they had their teaPerhaps the ending was a little bit confusing but it didnt stop me from really really enjoying the whole story,1
Basic structure of a story Beginning Middle EndSometimes this structure is played with and we get Memento or Irreversible and the story plays backwards Sometimes its just not linear a la Pulp Fiction Regardless they all have a beginning middle and endThis is the first film I have ever seen that doesnt have an endBeginning Girls best friend is expelledMiddle Girl needs to cope without best friendEnd Non existentNot that having an end wouldve saved this film but at least it would have been completeIts an exercise in apathy we get a partymix of characters and they all turn out to be duds Boring vain vapid and pallid imitations of peopleAnd heres the action within this film NOTHING HAPPENS Nothing at all happens Mischa Barton tries to talk with a plummy English accent Dominique Swain whines a lot and Brad Renfro receives a blow job from some old guy End of movieBy the time the credits rolled I had a horrible feeling that many prisoners must feel periods of time those precious minutes of our life have just been wastedThe only passable point and that is a very emphatic ONLY is Brad Renfro He acts well Lacey Chabert I tend to like but no luck here Due to good work in other films I will forgive Mischa Barton this travesty but I hope all cast members were slapped in the face for their involvementPlease I implore you Avoid Dont fool yourself into thinking Ill make up my own mind My sister told me to never see this and I ignored her wanting to make up my own mind That was a bad decisionI have never hated a film There are many I dont like but I have never hated a film Until I saw this,0
As everyone knows by now 15 Park Avenue is the story of a schizophrenic girl and her halfsisterThe manifestation of Schizophrenia is still viewed as being an illness which people often feel might disappear if ignored There are also those who however far fetched it may seem when its shown in the film think that the illness manifests itself as a result of some sort of supernatural influence I think Ms Sen deserves a lot of praise for 15 Park Avenue She has done a good turn not only to the general public but also to those who deal with schizophrenics relatives social workers psychoanalysts The film actually helps in dispelling a lot of myths and misconceptions about the exact nature of this psychological disorder Im told that the film is largely based on her own personal experiences with a person very close to her who suffers from this mental affliction To that effect Im sure that none of what has been shown is blown out of proportion on the contrary it is a true representation of factsThe performances are good on the whole as can be expected Konkona Sen Sharma Shabana Azmi and of course Rahul Bose are very good indeed They emerge as very real characters credible enough for one to be able to identify with them at times People may think me terribly queer but I think there are moments when one can identify with Meethi as well I suppose all of us have a streak of insanity inside us perhaps some more than others These are the people who are singled out After all dont we all have our secret fantasies and dreams Impossible ones at times Would we be dubbed as being off our rockers if people could glimpse into these areas of our minds Would a person with low selfesteem be considered a schizophrenic because heshe shuns company preferring instead to live in a world of hisher own because thats the only space where there is a sense of securityKonkona as Meethi is outstanding Her performance is so effortless she lives her part She has shown the ability to lull the audience into forgetting the divide between reality and acting A case in point is the part where shes distressed at the scene shown on TV of Saddam Husseins arrest Her reaction seems so uninhibited and intense as if shes really heartbroken at this tragedy Her brand of Indian English too is so spontaneous and natural However the same cannot be said for at least a couple of the other actors Kanwaljeet and Waheeda Rehman splendid actors both seem ill at ease when delivering their dialogue in English Their diction is less than perfect stilted and affected the fact that they are making a supreme effort becomes more than apparent Their dialogue delivery is jarring and tends to break the smooth flow of the unfolding of the taleThe brutal rape of Meethi Konkona seems somewhat unnecessary Any other incident would have sufficed just as well I feel The point here is that something triggers off the extreme manifestation of the illness As the psychiatrist explains one cannot with any modicum of conviction or certainty say that the incident of the rape was instrumental in bringing the hitherto latent propensity towards schizophrenia to the fore Then why are we subjected to the scene where Meethi lies bleeding and unconscious Was Ms Sen trying to make a social statement about the state of politics in our country where the voice of the masses is silenced by a handful of people who resort to violence in order to stay in power If so then the scene of the rape is warranted but not strictly in the context of the main body of the filmThe ending seems somewhat abrupt Is the audience expected to find a solution Where does Meethi disappear to Does Ms Sen want us to feel that perhaps what the psychiatrist says about whose reality is more real and hence credible holds true In other words is she trying to say that we are not without bias when judging who is on this side of the fine line between sanity and insanity Im not very sureA thoughtprovoking film on the whole and well worth watching However IF you are the sort of person who likes things to be neat and tidy everything cut and dried with a watertight solution to each issue that comes up this film is clearly not meant for you,1
I recently purchased Lost Horizon on ebay having vivid memories of the Things I Will Not Miss number from childhood I am an ancient 29 I also recently finished the novel upon which it is based I was so pleasantly surprised to find a genuine hidden treasure A wonderful cast brings such warmth and depth to a beautifully simple and elegantly told story subtly updated from the original film and by now quite a separate entity to the far more intellectual and thought provoking book by James Hilton Sally Kellerman in particular has a radiant presence as the suicidal neurotic Sally Hughes who gradually warms to the charms of ShangriLa Only Liv Ullmann flounders in her wooden portrayal of the schoolteacher a role far more suited to a Julie Andrews type The fact that Finch Ullmann and Hussey are all dubbed isnt important as it is almost impossible to tell The songs DO vary in quality the music being far superior to the lyrics but it is still a vibrant and engrossing film that really deserves a proper DVD release and a lot more recognition,1
THE MERCHANT OF FOUR SEASONS was Rainer Werner Fassbinders first shot at mainstream acceptance In a turbulent career of just fifteen years he managed to create an astounding body of work in film and theater both as a performer and a creative producer actor and director Although this movie might not appeal to many viewers the film has much to offer The storyline is fairly straightforward A man is ostracized from his upper middle class family due to emotional and economic problems and proves unable to control his downward spiral THE MERCHANT OF FOUR SEASONS is shot with a slavish devotion to elegant detail and each set is very carefully designed and constructed Every object on set seems painstakingly arranged so as to provoke layers of emotional texture Many religious paintings and icons decorate the walls of the various rooms and seem to speak to Hanss desperate quest for spiritual meaning or direction in his life Much thought was given to how lighting and color were employed to contrast and enhance the drama Several times during the film I froze the frame to marvel at the beauty of the shots composition I streamed this film and the print was nearly flawless and second to none Fassbinder employs his actors in an almost vehement AntiNatural style He does everything possible to prevent the actors from reacting in a normal or colloquial manner and this creates a rather stilted effect However by doing so he injects an almost hyperreality to the narrative Rather than the presentation of a mundane melodrama the actors almost militant lack of affectation forces the viewer to confront the film in a different manner Fassbinders film intentionally prevents the viewer from easily connecting with the characters trials and tribulations You are constantly on the outside looking in This will be a disconcerting experience for many but I found it to be a unique and satisfying artistic adventure,1
Recovery is an incredibly moving piece of work handling the devastating effects of brain injury on not only the individual but the entire family Without resorting to preaching or Hollywood sappy endings Tony Marchants drama presents a family in crisis in a realistic wayHighest praise goes David Tennant and Sarah Parish for their incredible performances I had presumed before watching the drama that I would see some of their previous on screen relationship in Blackpool bleed through but it never does Neither actor is recognizable from any previous work and I didnt see either of them as an actor playing a part during the entire 90 minutes In addition Harry Treadaways performance as the son just on the cusp of starting his own life in university was fantastic throughout the piece he shows the torn nature of a teenage boy thrown into the unwilling role as man of the houseAt times nearly every character in the drama is unsympathetic As the viewer I wanted to give each of them a good smack to wake up to reality stop moping and start adjusting to the rotten but very present change in their lives But under the same circumstances I see myself acting like any of them switching between trying to show the stiff upper lip to desperation to escape to anything including behavior that is completely unlike myself Its the shows greatest strength truth without sugar coating to force us all to think what wed be able to do under the same circumstancesThis is a difficult but mustwatch show I hope that it somehow manages to be shown in the US,1
Steven Vasquez directed and cowrote with James Townsend the star this strange little drama cum horror flick with evidently very good ideas and intentions make a gay film that takes a different storyline than the usual fare and make a drama that wants to be judged on its merits as a thriller So why doesnt it work For starters the film loses direction from the opening frame and wanders rather aimlessly throughout the film dead set on making a suspense thriller but getting sidetracked into satisfying an audience who wants to see nude encounters Not that that is a bad thing it can certainly enhance some films that have been Hollywood successes The film also tries to talk about coming out experiences in young men and women relationships disturbed parenting the club scene with all the wild antics that accompany such events and murder It is all a bit much to cram into a 96minute filmDevon James Townsend by all appearances is a successful kid with a kind girlfriend Jenna Sarah Kelly but he has an eye for boys and visits a bar where he meets Brian Alex Wilson who has been down the same path and can offer Devon assistance on every level They bond Devon comes out and the mysteries begin boys are missing in the neighborhood Devons stepfather psychologist Dr Kirk Tyler Dan Swett is not at all what he appears to be and despite Devons consoling mother Donna Sonja Fisher Devon is cast into the streets because of his new relationship It seems Dr Tyler is in a dark business with hunky Detective Cunningham Earl McDougle who apparently is investigating the missing boys Devon gathers his resources from his understanding girlfriend Jenna and her cronies and together the group unveils the dark doings of Dr Tyler and his detective sidekick And through it all Donna radiates warmth and understanding as the perfect mother of a gay boy etcSome of the actors are pleasing to the eye and there is very little the eye doesnt examine frequently but the degree of acting is at an all time low The only thing that makes us forgive that and in some cases it is just too poor to forgive is the feeling of commitment on the part of everyone involved Yes this is a low budget movie and yes the director needs time to learn his trade But in the end there is something to be said for the involved people to try to take a gay film to a different level Maybe their next one will be more polished Grady Harp,0
I see that the majority of the comments so far have been if not overly positive then at least positive I can not understand that The only explanation I can find is that the people who commented had something to do with the film because this is one of the worst movies Ive ever seen It makes Boggy Creek II and Mutant look like masterpieces of horror The acting is shaky at best and awful for the most part The entire movie is almost pitch black probably so they could shoot it all in the same location The monster looks like something from one of Roger Cormans worst films And the plotwell the less said about it the betterOne to avoid at all costs,0
Michael Stearns plays Mike a sexually frustrated individual with an interesting moral attitude towards sexuality He has no problem ogling naked dancers but when women start having sex with men thats when he loses it He believes that when women actually have sex thats when they lose any sense of innocence andor beauty So he strolls through the Hollywood Hills stalking lovemaking couples at a distance ultimately shooting the men dead with a highpowered rifle with a scopeThe seeming primary reason for this movies existence is to indulge in sexual activity over and over again The story comes off as more of an afterthought This is bound to make many a happily heterosexual male quite pleased as were treated to enough protracted scenes of nudity the ladies here look awfully good sans clothes and sex to serve as a major dose of titillation Of course seeing a fair deal of it through a scope ups the creepiness factor considerably and illustrates the compulsion towards voyeurism For one thing Mike eyes the couples through the scope for minutes at a time before finally pulling the trigger This is all underscored by awfully intrusive if somewhat atmospheric music on the soundtrackThose with a penchant for lurid trash are bound to enjoy this to one degree or another It even includes one lesbian tryst that confounds Mike and renders him uncertain how to react It unfolds at a very slow pace but wraps up with a most amusing ironic twist Its a kinky and twisted rarity that if nothing else is going to definitely keep some viewers glued to the screen710,1
I have not yet seen anyone slate this film and i think i may be the firstIt was awful I actually didnt watch the end of it It was like watching a boring soap or a really good one all soaps are crap The actors were poor and storyline was bad The person who rated it 1010 has no idea what he is on about The script was awful 2 People was in an angry conversation together involving threats and you expect the good guy to say some thing really good and beat the crap out of him but no He says If you do that I will hurt you Hahahahaha If comedy is your thing watch away Please do not watch this film because Its CRAP Summary Poor acting bad fights bad scriptDont watch Of course this is in my opinion,0
Whats in here Let me tell you Its the presence of Alec Baldwin Hes not a great actor but maybe a nice star with some good movies which this is not one of them He did nothing here more than anything he did before or after So not to mention literally the matter of Steve McQueen being at the same role in the original because I dont want to make that comparison in the first place Im not a big fan or even a fan of Kim Basinger she got a lot of bad movies on her and even at her best she looks average And it gets on my nerve indeed whenever they talk about her seductive rare beauty Well if being a blond would make anyone captivating then Ill dye my hair in yellow as soon as possible And what is it with all the craziness over miss Basingers Legs Its surely insanity or bad tasting As I dont see them both as not sexy only but UGLY too And if you hate that so shoot me down but you know what Ive just watched this movie so Im dead already Yet what would make you really suffer in unbearable way is that nothing of the credits goes to the one she deserves the most And of course I mean Jennifer TillyNow were talking about a true genuine seductive chick with such unforgettable body and one unique sense of allurement like a nasty brunette Marilyn Monroe however much more healthier I cant help it she was the only new and watchable thing in here Michael Madsen as the bad guy was much appealing as well as effective more than the good guys James Woods is here to summarize the early events beside the pool so the trailer would be by his voice later and he knew before all that this is a whole Hollywoods stuff so Do your thing take your cash and good luck as an actor in other movies the editing gave the movie a serious personality along with violent atmosphere done by suitable shining cinematography so the main goods of it The action The thrill are here and fairly wellmade though any echo for deep meanings about the kinds of betrayal as the main dramatic motif of the whole thing is not that strong so dont wait for it OK its all in all another remake without anything special Except Jennifer Tillys spicy moments so I think I tried to be objective as much as I could therefore I shouldnt end my review saying that Basinger or anyone here did better than this movie It would be an insult because frankly Anything is better than this movie,0
I saw this film a few years ago and I got to say that I really love itJason Patric was perfect for this weird role that he playedThe directorI dont too many things about himand I dont careThe screenplay is goodthats for sureIn just a few words I have to say about this movie that is weirdstrangeeven darkbut its a good oneI saw it a few years ago and never saw it since thenI want to see it again and againI know that Im not gonna get sick of watching itThe scenesthe atmospherethe actorsthe storyeverything is goodThe movie should have lasted longerI think 120 minutes should have been perfectI was hoping for a part 2 for this movieToo bad it dint happenedJason Patricyoure the man very good movie the end,1
I dont know why some guys from US Georgia or even from Bulgaria have the courage to express feelings about something they dont understand at all For those who did not watch this movie watch it Dont expect too much or dont put some frameworks just because this is Kosturica Watch the movie without prejudice try to understand the whole humor inside people of Serbia DID actually getting married while Bil Clinton bomb their villages gypsies in all Balkans are ALWAYS try to fck you up in any way they can LOVE is always unexpected pure and colorful and Balkans are extremely creative For those who claims this is a bad movie I can see only that the Americans sht like Meet Dave Get Smart etc are much much worse than a pure frank Balkan humoristic love story movie as Promise me The comment should be useful and on second place should represent the personal view of the writer I think the movie is great and people watch it must give their respects to the director and story told inside It is simple but true It is brutal but gentle and makes you laugh to dead,1
Not only was this movie better than all the final season of HLOTS But it was better than any movie made for TV I have ever seenLooking at the Top 250 I see that only one small screen movie has made it How the Grinch Stole Christmas I think it is time to increase that group to 2I will admit that the original series had several shows that were better than this but I didnt mind I just LOVED being able to enter the world of the Baltimore Homicide Squad again,1
This movie maybe really bad but it is alot of fun The bad acting and poor direction enhance the films hystericalness The twins are very funny in their Conanesque roles If you go into this film expecting the first Conan or Excalibur than you will hate it If you watch it while in a good mood and accept it as good dumb fun you will have a good time Watch for the scene where they try to hang the brothers its funniest scene in the film I wish Mystery Science Theatre 3000 would have done this,1
Fans of apocalyptic movies will savor this wellmade lowbudget thriller that is essentially a remake of the 1951 George Pal classic When Worlds Collide A comet is headed for a nearcollision with earth and when his fellow scientists disregard his warnings of doom eccentric scientist Peter Crawford Dennis Hopper gathers a group of private investors to secretly construct an underground sanctuaryThe story unfolds through the eyes of musclebound Gulfwar veteran Jake Lowe Peter Onoratiwho inadvertently discovers Crawfords hidden sanctuary and then decides that Crawford is wrong for keeping his project hidden from the rest of humanity As the comet approaches the subject of who should live and who should die makes for interesting dramaWhile the special effects are not in the same league I enjoyed the story more than I did Spielbergs War of the Worlds because I feel this screenplay is better Some suspension of scientific reality is required but its worthwhile for the development of a good story I highly recommend this film to fans of the genre,1
With a cast like this I knew the acting would be amazing Still I was cautious as I always am of sequels Would it sustain the feeling of the first film Could they possibly replicate the tension and thrill of the masterful heist of Oceans 11 Well never know because they didnt try At least not in the way I expected Instead they made a light and truly funny parody of the heist genre If you want a gripping logical heist dont watch this If you want a good laugh with witty dialogue quirky characters and an absolutely genius scene where Julia Roberts has to impersonate herself then youll love Oceans 12,1
When I die someone will bury me And if they dont whats the difference Who gives a damn huh Thus the philosophy of life or lack there of is summed up once and for all in this less than classic but nevertheless fun spinoff of Sergio Leones Dollars TrilogyIn the opening scene three obviously evil gunmen ride into a western town and with menacing glares they intimidate all the pathetic normal people hiding in their homes The observant watcher will notice that each of these three bears a striking resemblance to characters from Leones For A Few Dollars More There is one guy in Eastwoods poncho one in Lee Van Cleefs black suit and one seeming to act like Gian Marie Volontes Indio But this movie is not about these guys No sooner do they ride into town when they are gunned down by someone even cooler than they a mysterious bounty hunter known simply as the StrangerNo this is an altogether different storyIn an obvious copying of Leones The Good the Bad and the Ugly three gunmen are again vying for a hidden treasure Once again there is the bounty hunter and the Mexican bandit The Stranger George Hilton is a supercool bounty hunter with a penchant for shooting people while dressed up like a priest He is after the reward for the bandit Monetero Gilbert Roland But when Moneteros gang steals three hundred thousand in gold coins the Stranger gets sidetracked from his normal line of workTo round off the trio there is Edd Byrnes corrupt bank executive Clayton He too wants the money for himself But after the money is hidden away the only man who knows where it is gets shot Now the only clue to the hiding place is a medallion that shows a family crest The game is too find the treasure before anyone else does And any gun can playWith plenty of gunfights fist fights and double crosses the action takes these three to the ultimate showdown ripoff a three way draw for the hidden treasure ala The Good the Bad and the Ugly but with a twistThis movie is not as good as Leones films of course but in the end who gives a damn huh This movie is fun 60s nihilism spaghetti western style There are no rules no enduring loyalties and no right or wrong just the treasure and whatever it takes to get it And though the movie is not classic the ending surely is Hey maybe we all can get along after all for a hundred thousand a pieceIf you like spaghetti westerns check this one out It is fast furious and worth the look,1

I accidently felt on this movie on TV and I wasnt able to leave it Its really an excellent movie which makes people learning about americans history with the Vietnam war the flower powers time the racisms fight It illustrates the conflict of generation of political opinion of race which took place in the 60sIm born in 1980 so I didnt know all that stuff beforeIn france USAs history is not a priority and that movie really learned me a lot of facts By the way I think all the actors are great especially Jordana Brewster Josh Hamilton and Jerry OConnell Now I can see this film more then 1 time each day Its really great what a shame it only appeared on TV not in cinemas,1
Big Fat Liar comes as a welcome shallow but welcome breath of fresh air after one too many films featuring bathrooms bodily fluids pets on acid gaseous jokes and crotch gags After all See Spot Run Max Keebles Big Move and Snow Dogs had signaled The Degenerative Spiral of Kiddie Moviemaking Worse is the realization that the young audience would later be satiated by the smuttier offerings of Not Another Teen Movie and Slackers Written by Nickelodeon producers Dan Schneider and Brian Robbins who coincidentally costarred on the 80s sitcom Head of the Class the film stars Frankie Muniz as Jason whos always ready with a good lie to get out of scrapes Wheres the English paper Dad choked on a Swedish meatball His teacher Sandra Oh issues an ultimatum Turn in the paper by the end of the day or take summer school Jason whips out a story called Big Fat Liar and is struck en route to school by a limousine carrying insensitive Hollywood producer Marty Wolf Paul Giamatti Wolf gives him a ride but Jason leaves his paper behind No one will hear the truth this time and Dad tells him hes lost his trustMonths later Jason and best friend Kaylee Amanda Bynes see a movie preview for Big Fat Liar and head off to Los Angeles to wreak havoc on Wolfs life all to get a confession that he stole Jasons paper to make the film They even gain the sympathy of some of Wolfs abused employees including his assistant Amanda Detmer former chauffeur Donald Faison movie star Jaleel Urkel White playing himself and stunt coordinator a muchaged Lee MajorsBecause Big Fat Liar is without the edge that his sitcom Malcolm in the Middle is known for Muniz is easy to root for but doesnt have much to work with Likewise for Bynes who headlines her own Tracey Ullmanlike sketch show on Nickelodeon All the hamminess is given to Giamatti whose eyes bulge and cheeks wiggle with every sneering insultThe film gets snaps just by attempting the high road and should be enjoyed by its target audience especially since most of the high jinks occur on the Universal Studios lot But heres one headscratcher The message is that it pays to tell the truth But didnt we just see Jason getting to his payback by telling white lies throughout the film Well at least theres no poop,1
A tedious effort from notyet great director Budd Boetticher and pretty but notyet unbland actress Nina Foch this movie is as one of the other reviewers notes is the quintessence of a certain kind of B movie Its just not the good kind And a promising premise and an overactive fog machine is wastedBasic plot Nina a nurse on leave from wartime duties on account of her nerves has a nightmare She meets a dashing fellow at the resort where shes giving her nerves a breather and realizes hes in the dream even though shes never met him before Meanwhile it turns out our dashing guy is working as a spy and is about to go on anextra secret hushhush mission that must not failOf course there are Nazis And plot holes And smart people acting in a fashion most likely to get them into entirely unnecessary scrapes so that the running time can be spun out past an hour At the end the movie becomes a contest between which group of spies can act more foolishly If the FBI and OSS had acted like this crew wed have lost the war in 42The movie itself is rather flatly shot despite the best efforts of the fog machine and the acting as it seems to be in many of the Columbia Bs TCM has been showing lately is curiously unengaged Its less stylized than what one might find from a similarly budgeted Warner Bros movie but also less fun to watchBoettichers strength of course is a rather matter of fact style which allows the strong stories and acting in his Randolph Scott westerns to come to the fore Maybe the problem here is that such a style is not going to work when the script is lousy and the actors tired from their five film a year schedule,0
Sorry if I disappoint anyone about what I am about to say to this made for TV movie But I paid money for the movie and turned out this movie is disaster The directing is really awfully bad But after I looked up its information here I realized there might be reasons for the low quality of directing and producing Maybe they dont have budget but anyway Ang Lees Sense and Sensibility had little money too but it turned out a hit The director in this movie did really bad job in telling the story and the movie couldnt even keep up a rational continuity in itself It keeps pulling me outta scenes Maybe someone need to work hard on story line board The dubbed sound is also awfully bad My god Normally I would appreciate every movie because behind it lie ideas and imaginations of an individual but this time I am just mad I really wanna hit something HARD Just dont do the job if someone cant fulfill it to its best Bad arts its not even art what is it really hurt people,0
I have never seen this movie on its own but like many others who have already commented I saw it as an episode of MST3K Really terrible 70s television schlock But someone saw its potential because its just been turned into a 125 million flop called The IslandAnd to the person who asked whether there were ANY good movies made in the 70s I want to remind her that it was a golden age for American film with directors like Robert Altman and Martin Scorcese first coming into their own Not to mention little things like Star Wars 1977 Just a reminder that the 70s were far more creative than the 21st century has been so far,0
There was such a hype about a game show with Bill Shatnerand especially right in the wake of Deal or No Deal and 1 vs 100 So of course everyone had to tune in to see what all the fuss was about on the new game show What a disappointment As Ben Stein so stoically and nasally says woowwThe only thing likable about this show was the fact that you knew it would eventually be over Sitting through a full hour of it was like going to the dentistyou find yourself looking at the clock in what you think are 10 minute intervals only to find out that only a minute has passed but seemed like an eternity since you last glanced at the clock So why didnt I just switch the channel Well probably for the same reason most other people didntout of sheer optimism I mean no one really wants to think that a show with Bill Shatner could actually be SO BADPersonally from the first 15 minutes I never thought this was the kind of vehicle that would showcase the talents of William Shatner My chief complaint was that the set was so dark Watching it left me feeling depressed You kept on wanting to get ahold of a little excitement but there was just none to be had There was not even enough light on the set to get a feel of energy from the audience who you couldnt even seeDear Network People do not watch game shows to cure their insomniathey watch game shows to be excited and have a good time Please do us all a favor and lose this in the vault,0
This is classic 80s humor If you were a teen in the 80s this was a summer hit to go see It was a early look at those now super stars This and Better off Dead just are fun and silly movies to sit back and enjoy Everyone can admit they had a crazy summer when they were a teenager Even crazy family and friends like these characters To be introduced to some of these characters was so much fun The uncle who is crazy sitting every waking moment at a radio waiting to win a million dollars the grandmother who only likes the granddaughter and handed a bill to the kids after dinner the twin brothers who look nothing alike and to meet hoopz was so much fun This may not of won an award but it is just a fun movie to get lost in one afternoon,1
Probably one of the most boriest slasher movies ever badly acted and badly writtenTHE PLOT Five students staying behind during the holidays closing down a dorm but somebody has designs on them and starts killing them off one by one the main suspect is the creepy groundskeeper John Hemmitt played by Woody Roll or could it be one of the five charactersACTING Not that bad not that great either apart from Daphne Zungia who dies way too quickly and should have been the main heroine and the rest well quite dull although Laura Lapinski the main heroine sometimes has her charm and you do feel sorry for her in the endTHE KILLS Cant really see why they banned this the kills look fake mostly one guy has his hand sliced in half in the beginning which looks really fake but the others are quite nasty like one girl gets her head run over by a car one girl gets boiled alive and another gets burned aliveOVERALL Not really a great slasher could have been a lot better,0
Rose Does anything actually happen in this episode It introduces our two leads a slowwitted grinning idiot of a Doctor and an utterly uninteresting companion Theres no plot to speak of childish humour mixed with some extremely bad pacing and incidental music What else is there to say reallyThe End of the World A marginal improvement in that we see our first outerspace scenario Subsequently brought down by poor contemporary humour paperthin logic very poor pacing and tired SF clichsThe Unquiet Dead Best episode to date showing what can happen when someone knows how to structure an episode write interesting character dialogue AND integrate an intriguing plot Let down solely by the Doctor and RoseAliens of LondonWorld War Three Doctor who degenerates into farce What more can be said Penelope Wilton brings the proceedings a little gravity trying her best in dire circumstances Some poorly written and outofplace soap opera elements come to the fore in these two episodes and a return to poor pacing bad plotting and cringe worthy humoursatireDalek Not great however still far above the RTD fare to date The pacing and script are all fine though the Doctor and Rose still irritate The effects and menace of the Dalek are introduced well The finale however took an interesting premise that reduced the Doctors most notorious foe into a cuddly touchyfeely mess and turning a previously unseen menace to a blue rubber squid that looked like a childs toyThe Long Game The first RTD script to show any plot even if it was in a clichd 80s style Still it was marred somewhat by his usual overreliance on juvenile jokes placing it too far in the future to make logical sense and again poor pacing Not as bad as his previous efforts but instantly forgettableFathers Day The initial premise couldve been vaguely interesting but common sense and logic abandon this episode from the very beginning Also we are treated to a whole episode of Soap Opera Before you start thinking this is all about characterization remember theres a big difference between lame Soap Opera and characterization On the plus side it does prove RTD isnt the worst script writer so farThe Empty ChildThe Doctor Dances This started off in a mediocre way with some cringe worthy moments and some illogical mistakes that even a primary school pupil wouldnt make Well lit windows in a blackout anyone After this the first part takes a more interesting and sinister turn Florence Hoath truly steals these episodes showing us what an interesting companion couldve been like She could also act Instead we get the annoying and politically correct Captain Jack as the new companion The conclusion was a little hasty but sufficient The pacing and script improved with a reasonably good storyline making these two episodes quite atmospheric and intriguing Boom Town I have to be honest except for a few examples I had been so disillusioned by the current series that upon seeing the trailer for another Slitheen episode I gave up and didnt subject myself to the tortureBad Wolf Reality TV arguably the worst facet of the modern media is basically used as the premise Theres no subtlety whatsoever Do we get any interesting social commentary as in the likes of The Running Man or Truman Show No of course not This in an RTD episode so theyre basically here to cynically try and pull in the audience of said shows Once again logic goes out the window as were placed 200000something years in the future RTD tries pointlessly to shoehorn in some overarcing story here with no relevance other than its own existence and when the villains are revealed at the end They make empty threats and the Doctor grins once more like an idiot for the climax Faster paced for the most part than RTDs other efforts this has one or two interesting moments Otherwise another lacklustre instalmentThe Parting of the Ways The big finale More of a damp squid literally All of the Dalek menace set up in Dalek is brought crashing down as they become rather pathetic So many plot holes riddle this episode with typically poor contrivances Daleks want to harvest humans as Daleks but then vaporize entire continents Daleks can vaporize said continents but not destroy the Tardis in space The Tardis is now indestructible and can land anywhere even over people so they can be saved in it This ability cant be used to easily destroy the Dalek god The Daleks can vaporize entire continents but dont just nuke satellite 5 to destroy the doctor and instead let him play around The doctor is a pathetic coward without the conviction of his actions after eradicating his whole species to try and eliminate the Daleks These and many other holes aside we are treated to the lamest dues ex machina solution ever conceived joined with a near pointless story arcSo what can we say about the new series allinallWould this have gained a second series if it were anything other than Doctor Who with RTD behind it Would most of the episodes have been seen as anything other than unoriginal and forgettable if they were anything other than Doctor Who and had RTDs name attached I think notSome people would have us think we cant say anything against RTD since we owe him for bringing Doctor Who back to our screens However this at the expense of good characters and stories Personally Id rather not have a poorly planned ill conceived product churned out at that price Id rather wait till someone could come along and make a genuine effort For the most part this is the kind of puerile rubbish that gives SF a bad name marring what is otherwise the most creative genre,0

A fun concept but poorly executed Except for the fairly good makeup effects theres really not much to it There are obvious problems for example after taking what seems to be weeks and weeks to get from fat to normal size the main character seems to go from normal size to deathly thin in days and once hes deathly thin he stays pretty much equally deathly thin for what seems to be a long timeIn any case the movie has far worse problems than thatthe cinematography is decidedly lowbudgetTVshow quality and most of all the acting is pretty awful all around Robert John Burke seems to always be trying for some kind of weird snarling Charlton Heston impersonation and is literally painful to watch the only scary thing is that Lucinda Jenney and Kari Wuhrer are both even worseThe only reason why Im giving this movie as high as I am is that once the movie enters its last 13 or so and Joe Mantegnas character takes over the movie develops a fun campy cheesefest slaughterhouse feel and the gangsters crazy schemes for tormenting the totally obnoxious gypsies are somewhat fun to watch The ending if predictable is also nicely mean Avoid unless youre a KingoPhile or are REALLY psyched up at the idea of the voice of Fat Tony from the Simpsons terrorizing a gypsy camp,0
this is a wonderful film makes the 1950S look beautifully stylish Kim Novak is intriguing and compelling as a modernday witch with one foot in Manhattan and another in infinity All the supporting performances are terrific from Jack Lemmon as her bother Nicky to Ernie Kovacs as the author of Magic in Mexico who is working on Magic in Manghattan to Elsa Lanchester as the slightly batty as well as witchy Aunt Queenie And then there is the cat I have no idea how many witches besides me have named a cat Pyewacket but suggest a zillion Jmes Stewart looks out of place but only just as much as his character is out of pace in this weird subworld of magic and witchcraft Perfect And it has the perfect romantic happy ending which we believe in because movies of this vintage do have those happy endings Gillian and Shep certainly have as much chance to be happy ever after as Rose and Charlie Allnut in The African Queen another great film,1
No real plot to this one just a series of short skits acting out some VERY old jokes I chuckled once or twice in the beginning much to my chagrin But even at only 73 minutes this film wears out its welcome before too long and becomes stale and tedious with some nudity sprinkled in here and there to keep you awake Still as bad as this movie is and thats pretty putrid its a comedic gem compared to pretty much ANYthing by Aaron Seltzer Jason Friedberg Date movie Epic movie Meet the Spartans Also the song is sadly kind of catchy in a sad wayEye Candy 11 pair of tits 3 bushes 3 asses My Grade D Code Red DVD Extras Original trailer for this film and trailers for Beyond the Door Dead Pit the Farmer obsessed Ones Power Play Sole Survivor Wacky Taxi,0
I havent watched the movie yet but cant wait to see it It seems very interesting and inspirational It was one of the most interesting trailers Ive ever seen the questions it posed really stopped me and made me think the unique approach to the sport of boxing as a metaphor for the battle within thank god somebody is hitting another angle with the boxing thing This film looks so fresh and smart And the actor is really hot I especially enjoyed the short clip with the actor from the Rocky movies really clever I thought that the topic selectedovercoming adversities and childhood traumasis timeless and god knows a lot of people need it Bring it on,1
Crispin Glovers way of acting and not only his is tremendous You really want to believe him because his body language and performing fits the person perfect He gives Layne this extraordinary bit of personality that makes this movie a cult As well as Feck which role is done very well by Dennis Hopper Its about choosing the right or wrong side without logical thinking about the scene Friendship is more imported and thats exactly what I think is what makes choices this difficult Rivers Edge lets you experience this with serious tones and family mathers I really enjoyed it watching I saw it a month ago for the first time but if you like a nice 80s feel this is the one that you have to see Its a same that I didnt know of it earlier,1
The movie Gung Ho The Story of Carlsons Makin Island Raiders was made in 1943 with a view to go up the moral of American people at the duration of second world war It shows with the better way that the cinema can constitute body of propaganda The value of this film is only collection and no artistic In a film of propaganda it is useless to judge direction and actors Watch that movie if you are interested to learn how propaganda functions in the movies or if you are a big fun of Robert Mitchum who has a small role in the film If you want to see a film for the second world war they exist much better and objective I rated it 410,0
I love watching early colour films you mean those 40s clothes werent all grey Margaret Rutherford dominates this movie Her eccentric garb is actually rather attractive and yes she has an amazing hourglass figure But I feel she was given her head rather too much She probably developed this characterisation over many performances and nobody told her If it gets a laugh leave it out She does too much deranged fooling about when shes supposed to be surprisingly down to earth The Madame Arcati joke is that mediums were usually portrayed as wispy females in long drapery Arcati behaves like a retired headmistress Well really put our backs into it The contrast between her breezy commonplace manner and her wacky beliefs isnt really brought outJust because all the actors are English apart from Cummings the Americans feel they have to use the words Brit stiff lip and upper Oh give it a rest The three main characters lose their tempers constantly and make risqu remarks Did he make love to you Yes but very discreetly he was in the cavalry,0
Being a gay man who lived through the time period examined in this tedious documentary I was eager to see how the subject matter was handled Unfortunately the film makers wasted what could have been an energetic and insightful opportunity to shed some light on our collective gay history This film only concerns itself with the period within New York City ignoring the rest of the country While I spent a fair amount of time in NYC at that time I can assure you that there was a gay life outside Manhattan The men interviewed here are the same Alist queens who thought they were better than anyone else during the 70s and here they are again waxing nostalgic and still throwing attitude The film should have at least tried to cover larger topics such as race ageism the burgeoning gay caste system based on wealth body image and the rise of the clones discrimination of subgroups within the community and the ability to grow a decent mustache which was very important in the 70s Alas we have none of this presented and the recollections of those interviewed are no different than my own memories If you were there in that decade youll enjoy the archival photos and grainy homemovies of the bars and discos we haunted If you werent there this film will undoubtedly seem dull It should have been so much more but sadly its not Two stars for jogging my memoryI still miss going to the Anvil,0
I saw the trailer for this movie in the 70s when I was barely 16 while viewing another film Oh how excited me and my best friend were we couldnt wait for the month or so until it would come on I saw this movie 17 times that year at the theatre I lovelovelove it Kris is so perfect for the film He is brash and kinda trashy but also shy and uncertain with Babs and it is so endearing to watch it again When they sing evergreen at the studio and he chimes in with his raspy voice so very different from the perfect notes coming from her but I always thought this was one of the best scenes in the movie The way he looks at her and he is so proudI could watch this movie every day We tried to dress like esther I even have the long sweater and cap that was so like the one she wore this came on TV on time and I got my daughters to watch it they were teens and they loved it to Maybe its just that I was so caught up into it at an age when everything was extreme dont know The ending always has me in tears even today,1
After reading through many of the reviews I dont know what movie some people were watching but clearly it wasnt the same one I sawThis movie is horrible The acting primarily Moores is just terrible The woman cannot act Nice tits but she just cant act At no point did she come across as the actual character Instead it was spoiled Hollywood actress goes to the beach to play makebelieve with the boysAnd thats what this movie ultimately is Hollywood makebelieve The training sequences are over the top The politics over the top The political correctness over the top The combat scenes you guessed it over the top Your mission is to get in and get out without being detected So what do you do Why shoot off as many rounds and make as much noise as possible of course Oh GI Jane you can be my wing man anytimeThe premise is good but as soon as Hollywood gets a hold of it we end up with Top Gun with titsWhat more is to be expected from commercial US films anymore Not much I guess,0
The second not animated movie about the only people still refusing to surrender to the Roman Empire is even more hilarious than the first film Asterix Obelix contre CeasarWhere the first movie got all the laughs because all cartooncharacters were so perfectly brought to life without losing their cartoonesque identity this sequel which is a separate story as are all the comicbooks is even better Sure all the ingredients that you find in the first movie and in the comicbooks are present again Obelix is still dying to taste the magic potion that gives his other tribe members such enormous powers Caesar and the rest of the Roman Empire are still enemy number 1 but some new refreshing elements have been brought to the stage as wellNot only is setting very idyllic biggest part plays of course in Egypt but rather than repeating movie number one some extras have been added by making all kinds of references to other movies Bruce Lee etc This is all not very new but the unexpected combination of the known story from the comicbook with almost the same title as the movie and references to stuff that has got absolutely nothing to do with Asterix Obelix really worksIn that way the movie builds further on a tradition by comicwriters Goscinny and Uderzo who didnt hesitate to bring Laurel and Hardy on the stage and even dedicate an entire story to Kirk DouglasIf all of this doesnt convince you to watch this movie Im sure Monica Bellucci playing Cleopatra will,1
imagine 24 completely uncensored given free license to explain the situation in any detail needed and showing how and why both protagonists do what they do to killprevent and you have an idea of how good this TV series is People in the US have known for a long time that Showtime is the new HBO they are making far better cutting edge powerful shows and this is no exception The show takes the viewer all the way through the creation of a sleeper cell to when an attack is attempted taking in important facets such as faith religion funding means and needs To the uninitiated there is much to be learnt about the Muslim faith here Unlike on mainstream shows like 24 where the terrorists are merely nutcases who the good guys shoot their purpose and reasonings here are fully examined What gives the show more credence is the latest technology the cellFBI uses and the authentic shots in europe the US and the middle east no expense is spared to tell the story accurately The cast are relatively unknowns but the acting is superb with the aid of a tautlywritten script that constantly keeps the viewer on edge with many unexpected twists and turns This show has not got the credit it deserves and ironically is a bit of a sleeper hit itself must see for anyone at all interested in this genre,1
Satya was excellent Company was just as good but more polished probably owing to the money earned from previous movies Ab Tak Chappan however is even more entertaining The dialogue is gritty crude and at times hilarious Nana Pataker shines yet again in a role that only he can fulfill with authority but the supporting cast are very talented Direction is tight and the story evolves at a satisfying pace with a very dramtic climax As a depiction of reality it may be overdramatised but at the end of the day its a movie so the balance is spoton Ive ordered my DVD and cant wait to see it again at home As a lover of these type of gangster flicks this is very gratifying and comes highly recommended for the refreshingly nonYash Raj Bollywood gangster flick lovers out there,1
I admire Kissing on the Mouth for its frankness pubic hair cutting and masturbation especially from the leaddirector Joe Swanberg They werent afraid to show trueness to everyday private occurrences Unfortunately the film falls under the The Brown Bunny realm though with a slightly more developed plot of jealousy Yes it mirrors Bunny with a whole lot of nothing going on or too many cinematography shots focused or sincerely unfocused on absolutely nothing feet hands or genitals Again unfortunately I can see why this film was released and why people are renting true life sex scenes and full frontal equally both male and female nudity Other than that it was a complete waste of time We quickly learn of a postcollege malefemale roommate pair in which the male has obvious feelings for the female that sees him as just a friend while continuously having sex with her exboyfriend Other than that we are subjected to the everyday events of their boring lives she works for her parents he works on an extremely uninteresting sexual awareness project on his computer For this all to work the dialogue has to be interesting and the acting real Neither work and its as boring as watching someone drive for an hour ie The Brown Bunny The only actor that stands out is Kate Winterich and even she does some questionable acting The DVD extra with her in front of a mike is actually worth watchinglistening to Again I admire the filmmakers especially Swanberg for baring it all and not being afraid to expose themselves or showerhabits but overall the film falls flat It has narrations that doesnt fit the scenes too many boring everyday events and unconvincing acting that you wonder other than the softporn factor why you rented this,0
When a comedy movie boasts its marvelous soundtrack on the back cover you know your not dealing with a top notch movie I rented this movie with friends expecting to get some chuckles but overall to get most of our laughs off each other making fun of the movie We couldnt have chosen a worse movieThe movie may have been alright with a few changes First off the comedy was painful Physical gags were poorly performed and placed The fat kid in the movie made us want to kill ourselves bless him for trying scene in and scene out but he was like a puppy begging for love If he had been pulled from the movie everything might have been bearable There were some funny jokes I believe one was when the group of boys steal one of the parents porn movies and it turns out to be gay porn But to best sum up the comedy I will simply tell the opening gag for the fat kid He wears a puke stained shirt and talks about not knowing when something is doneTo finish off the editor of the movie could have saved the movie by removing the fat kid cutting out 20 minutes of the school scenes and making an ending that is longer than thirty seconds of random bickeringOH BTW there are two good elements that the movie possesses Kadeem Hardison plays his role wonderfully and performs his jokes so that none are missed or underappreciated The other redeeming element to the movie is the beautiful Mrs Ali Landry Her character is ignored most of the movie which is a shameDont waste your time even renting this one It didnt appeal to me and I was part of the target audience 18 male,0
After tracking it down for half a year I finally found a copy and it was not disappointingNot disappointing because Im one of those die hard SMAP fans who need to see all their works and I finally got to see the so called hot film of Goro But I couldnt believe Goro was forced to make a movie as such In his respectable self now Im sure he cringes that he made this movie Nevertheless they found the perfect person for looking embarrassed ill at ease and half depressed most of the timeMan I still cant believe he made this movieI had to cover my eyes at many parts not believing he really made such a moviehahahahaBut Im glad to have watched it Thank goodness he has grown up,1
This is a revised Riverdance presentation staged at Radio City Music hall in New York City Of the three Irish dance musicals that I watched during the mid to late 90s which includes the first Riverdance and Lord of the Dance I liked this one the bestI thought it was better than the original held in Dublin Ireland because it adds segments that are mostly good it has a more varied and colorful stage setting and it eliminated apiece for two from that original that wasnt good to begin with This is just a very solid show with few weak spots To be certain there are some songsdances that are just fair but none that are poor which is amazing considering there are 20 numbers in allThe cast is similar to the first Riverdance with the main exception of Colin Dunne replacing Michael Flatley as the featured dancer Both are extremely talented The major difference might be in their looks with Dunne a little goateed blackhaired guy while Flatley is the cleanshaven blond I prefer Dunne because Flatleys ego is so big he gets annoying at times The female lead Jean Butler thankfully is still there and is great to watch what graceful beauty and talent Butler and the rest of these women have the greatest legs Ive seen on dancers I also enjoyed the dancing of Maria Pages a Spanish flamenco performer and two guys Daniel B Wooten and Ivan Thomas One number with those two pairing off against Dunne and two other dancers 0 is called Trading Taps and is terrific fun to watch maybe the highlight of the whole show I have no complaints about violinist Eileen Ivers eitherThe fast Irish songs here appealed to me the most I appreciated the audience not getting in the way of the performance either with shrieks and screams like the women do in the Lord Of The Dance video,1
The first installment of this notorious horror series presents a woman being kidnapped by a gang of blackclad men who torture her for several days before finally killing herShe is beaten savagelyspun around in the chair endlesslyhas her finger nails pulledanimal guts are thrown at herhot boiling water is poured on her and finally her eyeball is punctured with a needlereally sick and nasty sceneThe makers of this unforgettable torture show tried to make it as real as possible and for me this one is the closest thing to a snuff film you can get without committing murder on tapeOf course some of the special effects are rather poor but the idea of making a snuff is pretty gruesomeI have seen also Flowers of Flesh and Blood which is more gory and sadisticbut less disturbingAnywaythis one is a mustsee for horror fans,1
This movie lost me with the crossbow RPG rocketpropelled grenade It was like someone cut and pasted a scene from Robocop I half expected Beowulf to say exclaim I LIKE ITI watched this because I like Chris Bruno from The Dead Zone TV show and he did his part He chose a strange accent but at least he kept it consistent for the whole movie unlike any of his costars They kept slipping into all kinds of speech from old English to modern English sometimes in the same sentenceThere are already many comments on how this movie is different from the source material However even on its own this movies plot is not good Its just boring which even the low budget doesnt excuse Having a low budget means that you need to at least have a good story dialog and decent acting Those things dont cost much Instead they spent their money on halfassed CGI and some decent costumes and setsLife is too short to watch this movie,0
Really dont care that no one on here likes this movie i do and thats what this review is about Lou Diamond Phillips is great in this comedic role that line about train a b and c is now to me an instant classic the cg is great yeah train looks a little fake but the aliens wow do they ever rock Todd Bridges wheres Arnold and Mr Drummond wow hes been out of the loop guess thats what jail does to you a bullet train is on its way to Las Vegas with the Senator for him to deliver a big speech a meteor has just hit and now all of a sudden we got aliens running loose aboard the train and our hero cop has to save the day to make matters worse his exwife is on board arguing with him i just thought this movie was so wonderful a must see if you like action,1
This film is a great rampage of action and comedy it gets right in to it right from the start theres no boring build up The chemistry of the leading roles adds to the excitement and anticipation of the ending even though my suspicions were not satisfied The special effects worked brilliantly and were believable Would have liked a different ending but it still had me reeling in emotions The story line unfolds well however it is a film you have to watch from start to end carefully to pick up on all the details to fully understand and get maximum enjoyment,1
This film is easily one of the worst ones I have ever seen And I dont mean that in a good way We wanted to see a crappy horrorthriller so we picked the one that seemed to be the lousiest in the store For once the film was everything wed expected And more or should I say lessThe actors look like they are reading their lines from posters behind the camera The socalled special effects are created by putting red seethrough plastic in front of the camera to give the impression that we are seeing through the eyes of the killer rats And the script Dont even get me started on the script And just when you thought it couldnt get any worse it turns out that the first part of the film was Oscarmaterial compared to the endingTake it from me this film is hilarious if youre into crappy horrorfilms but if you want a GOOD film keep on looking This is not for you,0
This kind of storytelling is unacceptable The only reason this film is anywhere above the 5 stars out of 10 line is because its got George Lucas behind it and it has the words Star and Wars in its title That is an insult to aspiring filmmakers and many others out there who have made clearly superior films with superior story writing and acting but did not get the credit This is a travestyFirst things first The story Anakins evolution There is none Apart from a little makeup around the eyes and a little yelling there is none He becomes young stupid cocky Anakin Skywalker to Darth Vader in a single blow The only thing consistent about Darth Vader in the original series was his intelligence how good he was at almost everything he did planning fighting you name it The only consistent thing about Anakin that is perceived in the prequel trilogy is his consistent stupidity He even loses his body because of a bout of stupid cockinessWhat part of the Emperor Palpatine telling him legends of the Sith does not point to the Emperor being a Sith UnacceptableThe fight scenes used too many digital doubles Everyones flying all over the place like teddy bears in a makebelieve doll house Count Dooku Emperor Palpatine Anakin ObiWan almost every fighter had a rubbery digital double jumping aroundIn one specific fight scene ObiWan and Anakin in the climactic battle they both actually stop in the middle of parries and ripostes to twirl their sabers a few times while inches apart I realize the fights are choreographed but that just got me shaking my head in disbelief and disgustThe writing was awful All the dialogue was of tremendously low quality The good actors like Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman did the best they could with their lines but that just wasnt enough I cant say enough bad things about this film Too much special effects plot holes bigger than the centre of the universe and absolutely no insights into any of the characters This is the biggest mistake of this film nothing new is offered We know the rough picture of everything all Lucas did was colour it inWe knew Anakin lost his limbs We knew Luke and Leia are brother and sister we knew Luke is Anakins son we knew ObiWan and Yoda go to exile we knew everything Nothing new is offered in this film If thats all the fans wanted then thats fine Lucas couldnt have gone wrongBut when Anakin finally becomes Darth Vader and he asks after Padme and hears she is dead he reaches out his arms awkwardly and screams Nooooooooooooooooooooo That scene screamed Bmovie all the way and I was half expecting Darth Vader to go DANGER WILL ROBINSON DANGER at any time That is what this is A Bmovie disguised by a huge budget and a ultraloyalist fan base that will settle with anything now that the first two movies have pulled their standards down to the pits of the Earth,0
With title like this you know you get pretty much lot of junk Acting bad Script bad Director bad Grammar badMovie make lot of noise that really not music and lot of people yell Movie make bad racial stereotype Why come every movie with black hero have drug addict Why come hero always have to dance to be success Why come famous rapper always have to be in dance movie Why come letter s cant be in titleHollywood need to stop dumb down audience and make movie that have people with brain who know how speak proper EnglishDo self favor and not go see,0
First time of seeing Buster Keatons first feature film and I have to admit I liked it a lot and only wish Id stumbled across it years ago The Rohauer blurb at the start warns that the Three Ages single nitrate print was rediscovered and salvaged in 1954 just in time before combustion and many frames that seemed hopelessly glued together were separated So its rocky viewing in places but Ive seen and survived much worseIt would have been OK as the 3 short films but as a take on Intolerance its inventive and funny from the start to the finish In the Stone Age with baddie Wallace Beery riding an elephant and goodie Buster riding a pet brontosaurus In the Roman Age Buster riding a chariot with wheel locks and adapted for sledging No Parking signs in Latin In this technological Age of Speed Need and Greed his car beautifully falls to bits at the first hump Both him and Beery are after the Girl through the ages a never ending tussle Favourite bit As the caveman he gets knocked backward over a cliff edge but still blows a kiss to the camera an amazing second or twoGreat stuff reaffirming my love of silent film comedy,1
If vampire tales are your cup of blood then this Gothfest based on the Anne Rice Vampire Chronicles should prove to be a satisfying experience A veritable consortium of the undead in a contemporary setting Queen of the Damned directed by Michael Rymer is a story of shadows and darkness and of the unfortunate souls who dwell therein for eternity The vampire Lestat Stuart Townsend bored with a world that no longer excites him has been asleep for many years but suddenly the sounds of that world he hears from his extended slumber change and liking what he hears he ventures forth to investigate What he finds is a world filled with new sounds a new kind of music driving and penetrating sounds that assault the senses and make him feel alive and welcome And he knows that at long last his time has come that it is time for him and those like him to come out into the open and face the world on their terms Toward that end he becomes the front man for a band a singer and performer unlike any the world has ever known He presents himself as a vampire and very quickly amasses a following that extends far beyond London where it all begins and will ultimately take him to Death Valley California where he plans to give a concert that promises to be beyond anything anyone has ever seen or experienced Lestat is powerful without question but there are those of his kind who do not take favorably to the fact that he has revealed them one of whom is Marius Vincent Perez a vampire powerful in his own right the vampire in fact who made Lestat so many years before and they are gathering coming together and making their plans to meet Lestat at the concert And they are not going for the music But there is something else as well At one point Lestat has inadvertently awakened the Mother of them all the most powerful of all the vampires Akasha Aaliyah who is about to make her presence known to all and especially to the one she has chosen to rule by her side as her King Lestat And at the concert rest assured Akasha will be in attendance without fail Make no mistake this is Lestats story and Rymer presents it amid a setting rich with atmosphere and with some exquisite moments though his film has less bite to it than say Interview With the Vampire or Bram Stokers Dracula He sets a good pace and there are some scenes that provide some real thrills but overall the film isnt as soaked in menace as it could be or as much as one might expect In the final tally in fact the amount of flesh that is incinerated wins out over actual bloodletting though there is more than a taste of gore and more than a fair share of lips and mouths dripping with the red stuff Theres some good FX on hand too especially in the sequences that accentuate the speed of the vampires as they move and hurtle through the air faster than the naked eye can discern Its a decent job by Rymer but he could have put more teeth into it had he played up the alienation hinted at by Lestat as it is you get a sense of his detachment but not enough to get you totally involved In Interview With the Vampire Tom Cruise brought some charismatic star power to the role of Lestat but Townsend is even more effective with a look and an attitude that captures Lestat perfectly He plays him with a sense of acceptance and under closer scrutiny you may even find a hint of remorse and longing Its a good performance and one that sells his character convincingly As Marius Vincent Perez does a nice job too he is in fact one of the strengths of the film though his character is a bit ambiguous that however has more to do with the way he was written than with Perezs performance which is quite good Turning in noteworthy performances as well are Marguerite Moreau as Jesse a young woman too curious for her own good and the gorgeous Lena Olin as Maharet Jesses Aunt who ultimately plays a pivotal role in the outcome of the drama involving Lestat and Akasha And as Akasha Aaliyah is an absolutely riveting presence What more can one say about her other than she is a gifted performer with tremendous talent and beauty And tragically she has left us much too soon The supporting cast includes Paul McGann David Christian Manon Mael Claudia Black Pandora Bruce Spence Khayman Matthew Newton Armand Tiriel Mora Roger and Megan Dorman Maudy With a much stronger story than the usual offerings of this particular genre Anne Rice fans especially will be pleased with Queen of the Damned a film nicely crafted and delivered by director Rymer and his engaging cast By focusing attention on the drama of the story and the way its presented rather than concentrating on merely providing some cheap thrills Rymer has succeeded in turning out a true horror film that is definitely a cut above and one that just may whet your appetite for more of the same And thats the magic of the movies I rate this one 710,1
publicity got me to the theatreadvice will take you away from this waist of timevery bad everythingdo you really want to see a monkey talking with a technological deviceX,0
I would watch this movie every time it was on cable and it never got old Who can forget some of the best lines in film history JOHNNYS FAT BOY BURGERS JOHNNYS FAT BOY BURGERS and LOOK BETWEEN THE GIANT MELONS I used to wish I could run all over the city in a treasure hunt as fun as this Its an alltime fave and Im happy to hear that its out on video Im positive that this is where MTV got its original premise for the Road Rules series,1
I watched this film because I thought it would be a classic Amy Adams movie Wow this movie is so bad on so many levels it staggers the imagination It is poorly constructed for one also the script and the acting is just awful But hey even Johnny Depp has a slew of bad films under his belt The upside of this movie would be Amy singing and even on that score I believe better songs could have been chosen Amy is of course beautiful to see and if you are a diehard fan of hers you will probably watch this title no matter what just dont expect too much I wish I could have found more to like but it was just painful to watch I recommend Sunshine Cleaning or Doubt,0
Initially I was put off renting this movie due to the jacket art for the DVD In fact this held true with friends of mine who didnt rent it due to the art and the mental images it conjured of being a movie that held little or no interest to me or to my friends But I rented and watched it and was truly amazedI agree with another users comments that this movie is not for everyone due to the blatant sexual inferences so it is definitely not something Id want young children to watch and doubt seriously if they would understand it anywayI enjoy movies like this whereby the characters personalities and who they are are genuinely defined in a nononsense direct way with no teasers to indicate they will turn out bad The acting done was it acting Ricci and Jackson performed so well I was drawn into this movie not even realizing they were acting Same thing with the story may seem farfetched somewhat but it was done so very very well It reminded me of another movie with Mel Gibson Tim where each character had limitations whether mental or circumstantial so were welldefinedI found much depth in this movie with the characters involved so feel that everyone involved from the cameramen to the actors should be commended on a perfect fitresult After viewing this movie I had talked to a couple of friends who had a negative approach to watching it like I did so after hearing my comments they rented and watched it They too were quite surprised at how good it was It is too bad that the art on the jacket was done the way it was since it is a turn off I can see now how the art applies but Id not heard of this movie before and the art was my first impression art sells or destroys DVD salesrentalsThese characters had more depth to them and good timing was allotted to give an audience like me time to absorb the feel for each I felt I could trust the movie to flow well and it did So with the jacket art aside I would recommend watching this movie,1
This was a good film with a powerful message of love and redemption I loved the transformation of the brother and the repercussions of the horrible disease on the family Wellacted and welldirected If there were any flaws Id have to say that the story showed the typical suburban family and their difficulties again What about all people of all cultural backgrounds I would love to see a movie where all of these cultures are shown like in real life Nevertheless the film soared in terms of its values and its understanding of the how a disease can bring someone closer to his or her maker Loved the film and it brought tears to my eyes,1
Might contain spoilersOk lets conclude this movie in one word bad Two words Really bad Now why do I think that Let me explain Guttenberg leads a specialops team consisting of four persons that get assigned to retake an lethal virus after some armsdealer stole it from a lab They do this by attacking the armdealers in midflight and somehow gets back the virus after some fighting However suspicions arise about Guttenberg because one of the terrorist knew his name After debriefing the teammembers get attacked by unknown persons and everyone starts to suspect everyone else is involved After deciding they cant trust their bosses they decide to once again steal the virus and try to lure out the possible attackersIn theory this is a plot that could have worked in a lowbudget movie that just aims to be aired on TV However the plot is compromised and the movie ruined in several accounts Firstly the plot is totally predictable and it is not fun to know how the movie is going to end after three minutes Second The acting is really bad or the actors are directed to act as dummys There arent many emotions change of facial expressions at all etc I was especially disappointed in Guttenberg that I believe can do so much more but fails completely in an attempt to be a rough actionhero In addition though I am not by any means any expert on the subject I totally believe I could assemble a better covertops team by picking up five strangers and train them for a week This seems to be a theme in the movie to do things as stupid and unprofessionally as possible This go for good guys bad guys and bystanders as well Then I sincerely doubt the scientific and technical consultants if any of the film For example I have poured liquid nitrogen over my hand and I didnt break instantlyDont know how to conclude this really but lets say that this movie has a predictable plot bad acting and they seem to be amateurs in whatever the do Sorry cant be any nicer than that Do not watch this movie it is not even so bad it is funny 210,0
I normally like Casper in his movies a real credit to STARSHIP TROOPERS But the box cover on this video SSOOOOO misleds the renters At my local video people rent it expecting a PERHAPS Borg like vampire and instead they get a bad remake of Lon Chaney It had great potential and fell very flat Ireally think I could have written a better story line and screen play Why is it in EVERY science fiction movie they the cast constantly refers to a solar system as a galaxy Didnt any of these screenwriters or authors stay awake in science class It is a pet pevee of mine but a solar system is a single star with planets a galaxy is a WHOLE bunch of solar systems It is like referring to a can of coke as a gross of six packs Makes it sound even dumber,0
I read comments about this being the best Chinese movie ever Perhaps if the only Chinese movies youve seen contained no dialogue long drawnout faraway stares and silences and hack editing then youre spot onComplicated storyline Hardly Try juvenile and amateurish Exquisite moods and haunting memories Hardly Try flatout boring and triteThis was awful I could not wait for it to be over Particularly when the best lines in the movie consist of How are you Im fine Are you sure Yes Wow What depth of character I guess the incessant cigarette smoking was supposed to speak for themAs a huge fan of many Chinese Japanese and Korean films I was totally disappointed in this Even Zhangs sentimentally sappy The Road Home was better than this,0
This show was appreciated by critics and those who realized that any similarities between Pushing Daisies style and anyone elses was not a steal Yes Ive seen Amelie Pushing Daisies is somewhat similar but still different enough to be original Rather there are too few shows on TV that have this kind of quirky charm The greatest similarity is to Dead Like Me but PD comes by that similarity honestly Bryan Fuller created both shows Both shows involve an undead young woman For example This show never stopped being funny and charming and it was always odd yet was consistently humaneI must say a word about the conventions of ongoing story lines some people have complained that this show lacked a moral center because in the first and several subsequent episodes Ned seems to get away with causing the death of Chucks father without consequences of any kind First of all this must be a new definition of without consequences of any kind because in spite of the fact that Ned was only a boy and did not realize that he had caused the death of Chucks father he nevertheless felt guilty from the moment he realized what he had done Further about a dozen episodes into the series Ned finally did confess to Chuck that he had caused her fathers death with his gift Now there are no police to charge people with magically causing one persons death by bringing another person back to life so the questions of absolution and restitution have to be taken up without societal guidance In other words its between Ned and Chuck who was not inclined to forgive Ned anytime soonBut this does point out a problem with continuing story lines in network dramas I remember when David Carusos character on NYPD Blue did something wrong and it seemed he got away with itfor a whole yearthen he got caught and was forced to resign from the job and left the show The point is viewers should learn by now and not assume that just because a regular character does something wrong in a single episode and is not caught in that episode that he has gotten away with it There is always next weekand maybe even next year,1
Val Kilmer and Dylan McDermott are terrific I have seen Kilmer on The Doors however his interpretation of John Holmes is superb Nothing compared to Boogie Nights which was kind of slow Wonderland is a movie which is able to show you a horrible crime story from the perspective from a guy who is just indulged in his drug vice and indolent of what ever happens around At the same time the John Holmes character shows a very clever hustler who is able to pass through the nastiest and ugliest situations almost unharmed The movie deserves being watched more than once The seventies ambiance sensual and full of drugs is amazing,1
A prequel to the reimagined Battlestar Galactica series from the same creative team Ronald D Moore and David Eick as well as new series cocreator Remi Aubuchon Caprica is set in the twelve colonies some 58 years prior to the events of Battlestar Galactica The new series in addition to its human drama also chronicles the key steps in the development of what would become the Cylon raceThe pilot and the series are set to follow two families the Graystones which include Daniel Eric Stoltz a computer genius and corporate tycoon and his equally brilliant but rebellious daughter Zoe Alessandra Toreson while the Adamas include Joseph Esai Morales a lawyer and his son William the future Admiral of Battlestar GalacticaLike Battlestar Galactica the series includes some great experienced actors in Eric Stoltz Esai Morales and Polly Walker as well as some very talented relatively new actors including Alessandra Toreson and Magda ApanowiczFor fans of Battlestar Gallactica there are similarities and continuities with that series but it is also very different In the pilot at least the science fiction elements are definitely present but are smaller part of this series The scenes on Caprica while reflecting a more technologically advanced society also have retro feel this is achieved through some of the architecture the costumes and the way it is shotWhile the look and feel of the two series have some substantial differences some of the themes will seem very familiar religion is again very important here while the racial theme rarely touched on in BG is far more important We also touch on terrorism the existence of a soul and whether or not a machine can have one as well as issues related to crime and governmentThe pilot has been released direct to DVD in an extended and unrated version prior to airing on TV the series is set to start in 2010Like Battlestar Galactica this series is filmed in Vancouver,1
This film must have done well in the box office in order to give Gator the budget it deserves This film had no budget needed a script rewrite and a better ending There is flashes of brilliance in this movie The boat ride scene Burt driving the mean machine and his chat with his parents You can tell Burt is a Southerner and not a actor This movie shows what Gator would be like Burts best film Too bad this film did not have the same funding and was done on the Rush 410,0
I first saw this movie in a theater in France a year or so ago It came and went with little fanfare but I enjoyed it for the beauty of the landscape photography and the fascinating wildlife footage The story while nice is really incidental If you actually thought about it there is no way most of what happens could happen in real life I just saw it again tonight here in the States on DVD Again I gather it has very limited distribution Blockbusters only had one copy of it and I dont recall it ever playing in the art houses in ClevelandSeen on my TV the photography is not as breathtaking though it is still very beautiful The wildlife footage is still fascinating The story of the relationship between the 10year old child and the fox is even less convincing the second time around when you know where its headedStill as I said the story is incidental Its a beautiful film to watch and if you like wildlife footage you should find this fascinating,1
I passed this one on the shelf a few times looking at the myriad of huge positive quotes with tiny names on the front and wondering if I was missing something The other night it was on one of the movie channels and I tuned in I missed nothingI must admit that I only watched the first 30 minutes Perhaps the movie becomes comedy gold after that Given the slow plodding pace and complete lack of laughter in the first 30 I seriously doubt itThe lead character starts the movie in classic I dont know how to start my movie style with a long tiresome monologue about how he doesnt want to get sued Its not funny Its not even remotely funny Others have commented on the San Franclisco bit ok a small chuckle the first time he says it Then he grinds it into the ground smiling at the camera like its the funniest thing ever written Get over yourself In fact I think the talking to the camera bit was the reason I instantly disliked the film Dont assume familiarity with your audience Familiarity is earned much like respectFrom there you basically have a fat whiny guy talking in a very effeminate way about his dull life as a temp I didnt realize hes Jewish its a discredit to Jewish comedians to call this Jewish humor Its just unfunny humor Just because youre Jewish doesnt mean you have a knack for the comedy A WASP Spalding Gray does a better job of selfanalytical humor than this guy so obviously its not about ethnicityIf one of the bits I had seen had worked I might have stuck around But some schlub going on about how much he loves the names of the women he works with then listing them for five long minutes doesnt make a great movieThis is an obvious attempt to capitalize on the popularity of Office Space Dont let yourself become a victim of target marketing Just say no to Haiku Tunnel,0

you cant take it realistically sheetsZombie Bloodbath 2 ZB2 is a world all of its own Ive really never seen anything like it The only thing I can think to compare it to is psychedelic drugs Forgive the clichI dont simply mean that its incoherent and absurd though occasionally it is I mean that it takes you through such a broad range of intense experiences and unexpected emotions so quickly as to overwhelm you and when its over you find that its all happened while you were sitting on the couchIt is worth noting that its extremely lowbudget as a disclaimer to those who after seeing Shaun of the Dead consider themselves fans of underground zombie films Also of note is that it is much more brutal than youd expect Children get disemboweled and someone taunts a teenage girl before shooting her in the groin Her corpse is subsequently raped These are certainly not flaws and indeed I feel it is to the films credit But if it doesnt sound like your kind of movie dont waste your timeI dont mean to overhype it regarding brutality Dont go in expecting Inside or something I hesitate to give away any of the plot because its really full of surprises Even the opening scene which has nothing to do with zombies is at once a classic horror scene and something quite originalMan Im three paragraphs in and Ive hardly said anything at all Heres why I thought the movie was awesome 1 Its big and it keeps moving At one point you expect it to turn into another NotLD clone a boardupthewindows movie where everyone stays in a farmhouse and argues with one another By the end of the film however the farmhouse scenes will seem like a distant dream There are also a number of outdoor urban scenes These are rare in lowbudget zombie films2 The makeupgore is much better than ZB1 More convincing and more creative Something kind of funny the early zombies look really lame Then halfway through they suddenly look really good with prosthetics and everything Some of them look like Fulci zombies some are reminiscent of Mr Tongue from Day of the Dead And its got big scenes of dozens of zombies shuffling around Never gets old3 Theres something oddly emotional about it One character asserts that heaven exists and that our deadundead protagonists are now in heaven In the context of the film we believe it to be true Though the characters behave with typical horror film stupidity they genuinely seem to care about each other and accordingly I found myself caring about them4 The pacing is great Theres hardly a dull momentMy only observation that borders on criticism is that Todd Sheets comes up with the most bizarre dialog Ive ever heard I personally feel it adds to the experience but I dont think he does it on purpose so I cant fairly give the film a perfect rating Example when a car breaks down the owner yells at the passengers Then he says something to the effect of Sorry I yelled at you guys You dont know what its like to have your dad standing over you with a straight razor when youre five years old wtf At the very end it gets to be more than I can handle Involves a montage with Bill Clinton and then some preachy end credits explaining the zombie metaphor Really by this point I was firmly reliving my drug experiencesHighly recommended 710,1
Is this the future that awaits us An overpopulated unforgiving wasteland with a hellish unwanted existence This film brings to mind a problem that still plagues us doubly so since the film was released in back in 1973 Lets hope that the world isnt going to end up like thisSoylent Green is a wild movie that I enjoyed very much It had likable characters a semiapocalyptic setting a compelling and thoughtprovoking storyline and the machoest macho man out there Charleton Heston Richard Fleischer gave the movie a very unpleasant dirty feel Youre almost choked by the stench from the city and its filthy inhabitantsThe characters are wonderful Charleton Heston who has become one of my favorite actors IS Thorn The man created this role of badass yet likable toughguy I could definitely put myself in Thorns shoes He sees that something isnt right but everyone around him either doesnt listen more like paid not to listen or wants him dead Edward G Robinson in his last film RIP plays the lovable old Sol who has had enough of this nasty place Everyone else is great especially Leigh TaylorYoung as Shirl a piece of furniture that comes with the apartment in which she residesThe special effects are fantastic even for 1973 The Soylent Green factory the futuristic apartments and especially the scoops bulldozers that get rid of people were excellent The polluted air outside looks disgusting and very nasty The empty city streets filled with the vile and putrid people are very unsettlingOne final note is the ending which even now still shocked me It is gruesome but if you think about it its a pretty good ideaThe Bottom Line An excellent 70s Science Fiction flick that makes you think and leaves you feeling very uneasy,1
This movie is trashpoor It has horrible taste and is pedestrian and unconvincing in script although supposedly based on realevents which doesnt add much of anything but make it more of a disappointment Direction is not well done at as scenes and dialogue are outofplace Not sure what Robin Williams saw in this character or story To start Williams is not convincing as a gay in a relationship breakup nor is the relationship itself interesting Whats worse his character is compelled by an ugly pedophile story that is base and has no place as a plot device You have an older Rory Culkin tastelessly spouting dcksmker in good fun which is annoying enough and then laughed up by the Williams character Finally you have Sandra Oh as a guardian angel adviser to Williams and a thrown in explanation of the whole fiasco towards the end Toni Colletes character is just plain annoying and a rehash of her 6th Sense performance with poorer direction Very Missable,0
I never trust the opinions of anyone regarding a film That goes for critics as well Sure if it gets positive reviews thats OK and a plus but most films that get critical rave I hate I enjoyed this film for what it was an entertaining film It takes you out of your life for a couple hours and into a fictional characterthat being Catherine Trammell Sharon Stone is awesome in this role just like she was in the first one Anyone who says she is horrible in this film must have felt the same in the first one bc she is back acting the same way she did in Basic Instinct 1 Catherine is hers and she plays her to perfection Her one liners are great much like in the first one Who can forget in the first film when she tells the cops If youre gonna arrest me do itotherwise get the fk out of here Great scene and believe me she does it again in this one I was captivated by her Her outfits the way she smoked her cigarettes believe me its worth the price just to see Stones performance I cannot wait for this film to be released on DVD uncut because I can only imagine how much better it is going to be And yes there are lots of twists as in the first one including the ending,1
That this film has such a low IMDb rating is not surprising In our postEnron era do we really need any more reminders of Americas obsession with the greed creed The topic has become so politically charged that a lot of viewers not only are not going to be entertained by movies of this sort but will respond with barely concealed rage It was all I could do to sit quietly through this cinematic memo of corporate corruption without extracting the DVD and smashing it into a thousand piecesWhats really irksome with these kinds of films including Purpose is their pretense that behind the glitter theres some meaningful message that makes the film worthwhile In Purpose I found no such meaningful message What I did find was a story that idolized the materialistic trappings of capitalistic power and wealth The two main characters nauseating in their glibness do very little actual work Instead they party they play golf they strut their coolness they sound hip with dialogue straight out of MTVculturespeak rock my world and Now get back to partying thats an order John is smug selfimportant shallow and smirks a lot Robert who wears funky little glasses is even worseThe film includes two youthful garage geeks who look and sound like theyre right out of the film Antitrust 2001 Stereotypes are played for all theyre worth and in this film also include chiclooking computer equipment and Barbie doll chicks on hand for those occasions when our cando future billionaires need some relaxation after all that heavyduty partying And with the timebound images and dialogue that such a story necessitates can you imagine how dated this film will be in fifteen yearsAbout the best I can do for this waste of cinematic celluloid is to say that it does have some nice aerial views of San Francisco The film would have been a lot more enjoyable a lot more entertaining if they had ditched those odious characters and that repulsive story and simply flown us viewers around in that little plane for the films duration,0
I wish I had something more positive to say about Devil Fish but I honestly cant seem to come up with much I cant even come up with many of those so bad its good kind of moments Devil Fish is just plain old bad The plot is completely derivative Jaws anyone the acting is wooden the characters are uninteresting the special effects are beyond bad and the score is annoying Add to that the seemingly inept direction of Lamberto Bava and youve got one stinker of a movie I think however that the films biggest sin is its lack of a budget It doesnt appear that Bava had much to work with By 1984 the Italian film industry was in full decline especially as far as genre films go The funding available to Bava was most probably very meager Films like Devil Fish that rely on special effects just never had a chance to be good Its not the only Italian film to suffer this fate There are a number of Italian movies made in the mid80s whose ideas and concepts far exceeded what anyone could realistically have expected given their budgetary limitations However having said all that and noting the films many weaknesses I cant bring myself to rate Devil Fish lower than a 310 Ive even considered rating it higher but cant because I realize how bad a movie it is Why dont I rate it lower Well thats hard to explain Despite the many problems found in the movie theres something about Devil Fish that I inexplicably enjoy It could be as simple as my love for lowbudget cheesy Italian movies Maybe my taste in movies is horribly skewed but I enjoy what I enjoyThe Mystery Science Theater 3000 treatment of Devil Fish is actually very enjoyable I rate Devil Fish a 45 on my MST3K rating scale The guys do a fine job of poking fun at the movies many flaws One very astute observation comes very early in the commentary when Tom Servo notes Just because you can edit doesnt mean you should highlighting yet another of the many weaknesses to be found in Devil Fish,0
I find this film meretricious tentative lethargic and skillfully a bad choice of entertainment on celluloid But I admire the courage to throw away a script turn the camera on and act a fool I find the inauspiciously performances lighting cinematography sound and whatever film school laws D Urville Martin broke funny Speaking from a film directors perspective there is times I just want to drop everything and have fun on the set This film looks like fun When other aspiring film directors ask me advice I just tell them to watch any film by Rudy Ray Moore They always return a puzzled look asking me why not watch the masters Woody Allen Scorsese Lucas Capra I laugh and include that you always want to know what not to do in cinematic story telling first,1
A Lassie movie which should have been put to sleep FOREVER Thats how Id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film So mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies Ive seen It isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie The idea of Lassie turning bad is intriguing but so little actually happens and so slowly that you feel your life slipping away while sitting there watching the nonactors read their lines off cue cards waiting for their measly paychecksIts an empty hollow shell of a movie Seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on Unless youre both heavily medicated Thats all I have to sayAvoid avoid avoid It will drive you barking mad Hahahah get it BARKING Hahahahahahaha Sorry Ive had a rough week,0
This 1939 film tried to capitalize on the much better Michael Curtizs film Angels with Dirty Faces As directed by Ray Enright the only interesting thing is how tamed these kids were in comparison with whats going on with the youth in Americas inner cities todayThe film is only worth seeing because of the presence of Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan who showed they were well paired together The Dead End kids have larger parts as the plot concentrates on them rather than in the older folksIn a way its curious how arson was used in the same way some scrupulous landlords did in later years right here in New York It was the quickest way to turn a property around never considering the social problems it created In todays climate with so many guns around there is a new reality The young kids of the story seemed mere pranksters rather than criminals How times change,1

This was a fantastically funny footie film Why wont they show it again Tim Healy was superb as were all the players Direction was inspired and some of the gags were matchless The sloping pitch had me on the floor Show it again ITV so I can video it,1
This has got to be the worst case of over acting since the silent era Not just one or two actors but virtually the entire cast Lee Majors and Bo Svenson were fine but the rest of them look like their first time actingSo the budget was not tremendous Much of the costumes and set were believable but there were many things that jump out at the viewer to let us know that they couldnt double check or get all of the props to match the periodI cant think of one aspect of the film that I liked or didnt shake my head Your time will be better spent burning lint collected from your bellybutton,0
I really think that people are taking the wrong approach at this one First of all I find this shortfilm very entertaining and interesting I just take it for what it is I think the suspense and mystery are ingenious in their insinuation upon the watcher One other thing that caught my fancy was that it immediately gets the viewer involved even though there is no clear story just hints and pauses and emotions played out by the characters that kind of give you the impression that there is a story to all that is going on Noone else could have done that better than Lynch This is the essence of lynchianism at its best Sure I will agree with anyone that people that start viewing this with the desire to be entertained without any really imaginative work from the viewers side will find themselves disappointed And in good right Lynch is not about that At least this side of Lynch is not The one that helped make Lost HighwayMulholland Dr is at full tilt here and people that just expect to be entertained like they would watching anything else will just not get what this is all about My opinion is that Darkened Room is all about messing with your animalcore your instinctual self by giving you the means image sound situation by which you instinctively react Its not about pleasure of any kind its about getting the desired reaction out of you And that my friend is pure art,1
This film was recommended to me by a friend who lives in California She thought it was wonderful because it was so real Just the way people in the Ohio Valley are Im from the area and I experienced the film as Just the way people in California think we are Ive lived in Marietta and Parkersburg and worked minimum wage jobs there We laughed a lot we bonded with and took breaks with people our own age the young people went out together at night The older people had little free time after work because they were taking care of their families The area is beautiful in the summer and no gloomier in the winter rain than anywhere elseAside from the if you live in a manufactured home you must be depressed condescension the story lacked any elements of charm mystery or even a sense of dreadMarthas character was the worst drawn Its doubtful that anyone so repressed would have belonged to a church but if she had she probably would have made friends there Ive read reviews that seem to assume Martha was jealous of Rose because Rose was younger prettier and thinner but if this is the case it isnt shown All we actually see is Martha learning to dislike Rose for reasons that would apply just as much if the three friends had been the same age and gender We see Martha feeling left out during smoking sessions left out of the loop when social plans are made used but not appreciated and finally disrespected and hurtJust one more thing Are we supposed to suspect Kyle of murder because he had once had a few panic attacks Please This takes stigma against mental illness to a new level,0
This was the second MST3Kd movie I ever saw and still holds a place in my heart as one of the most hilariously awful film experiences you are ever going to have Miles OKeeffe sp is in this using his chiseled physique to score another payment on the mortgage on his condominium Hes stiff wooden and unconvincing but he still comes across as a cool likable guy and at least hes photogenic Thats the only decent I can find to say about the movie so I thought I would get it out of the way right up front The fact that he is in the movie adds another point to the score and saves it from being a 1 out of 10 In no particular order examples of how badly put together this film is1OK the Tanya Roberts clone Mila quests to the ends of the earth to find Ator which takes 3 minutes of screen time including the time she spends stumbling around dying from a poisoned arrow in her shoulder which I assume would have slowed her down quite a bit So Ator heals her up and takes his trusty aid Thong and sets out to go back to the her castleand proceeds to take the next 50 minutes of the movie recovering the ground that Mila traversed in 3 minutes How does that work I know that the intrepid crew is being harassed by magical forces and enemies etc on the way back but still2Apparently the writerdirector felt the need to add depth to the film by adding a running debateSocratic dialoggame of 20 questions between Zor the mean John Saxon wannabe and the wise man Akronas the Richard Harris wannabe But Joe Damoto apparently got his philosophical training from Hallmark cards TShirts and bumper stickers and he doesnt understand tempo pacing or timingand neither do the actors Crows remark during one of these exchanges is the tag line for my entry The scenes with these two drag on and on bringing the movie to a screeching halt and killing any momentum or excitement generated by the swordfighting and questing of the heroic trio3 Once Ator arrives at the castle and is captured things go even farther downhill Zor decides to feed a bunch of women victims along with Ator and Mila to the Serpent God he keeps in his basement This scene had some potential for excitement so the director immediately kills this potential by instilling the scene with all the drama of people waiting in line at the DMV to pay their traffic fines Ator proceeds to have a big battle with the Serpent that is barely more convincing than Bela Lugosis battle with the rubber octopus puppet in Bride Of The Monster 4 The climactic scene in which Ator invents the hang glider out of twigs and animal skins is so patently silly that it completely blows the viewer out of the movie and makes you roll on the floor laughing until your sides hurt 5 Oh yes and the filmmakers decided to include stock footage of an atomic explosion at the end with the moral that Ator decided to destroy the atomic nucleus McGuffin that drives the movie because mankind was not ready Zzzzip MESSAGE COMING IN Just like Bride Of the Monster again come to think of it All it needed was a bystander to observe They tampered in Gods domain6 For some reason the version of the movie I saw features introductory and closing homoerotic credit sequences that have absolutely NOTHING to do with anyone or anything else in the movie I have no idea where this footage came from but it is actually WORSE than the actual movie it bookends Watch this only if you are a big fan of Miles or if you enjoy the way MST3K skewers material like this,0
Shakespeare said that we are actors put into a great stage But when this stage is Israel the work that we interpret multiplies for ten and all the actions we do are full of a hard style Dan Katzir manages to do a spectacular portrait of a part of life in Tel Aviv but besides Katzir manages to penetrate into the heart of the Israeli people and this people far from being simple prominent figures they speak to us from the heart Katzirs film allows Israel escape from dark informative crux in which they live and this wonderful country arises to the light as a splendid bird which is born of his ashes It is very great for me because the reality of state of Israel which the Europeans only know for the informative diaries or the newspapers appears as a close and absolutly human reality the reality of million people who looking for his place exploring the whole state the whole culture with the only aim to feel part of it Katzir constructs an absolutely wonderful documentary and he demonstrates that when a man films with passion the deepest feelings are projected with force and these feelings cross our hearts Thank you Dan for open our eyes and give us one of the most beautiful portraits of the most wonderful countries of the world,1
Macy Ullman and Sutherland were as great as usual Ritter wasnt bad either Whats her name was as pretty as usual It could have been a good movie To bad the plot was atrocious It was completely predictable trite and boringFrom the first 15 minutes the rest of the movie was laid out like a childs paint by numbers routine The characters were stock pieces of cut out cardboard There was nothing new or interesting to say and that completely outweighed the acting which was a pityFinally too bad the script writer wasnt the victim Especially with the precocious lines from the child which were completely unbelievableAgain its only the acting that prevented a much lower score,0
In all truth this really isnt a movie so much as an extended final episode by this I mean that had you NOT followed the TV series Homicide Life On The Street I suspect that you would have a hard time following this madefortv movie Having said that Homicide The Movie is still a great watch I think it says a lot about a television production that EVERY single cast member would return many after years of absence to once again portray their characters and bring closure to an incredible program The movie brings out that sense of family not only amongst the characters but amongst the actors as well Its all very bittersweet knowing that this will be the LAST time we will see them all together again under the title of HOMICIDE Storywise I found this film somewhat lacking Giardellos mayoral candidacy seems particularly contrived and I felt his shooting couldve been dealt with within the parameters of his regular position as Leiutenant Also Det Baylisss extreme plot twist which was left hanging at series end is finally resolved but I for one NEVER felt that it needed to be I enjoyed being left with a mystery let us recall that the very first episodes first case also went unsolved for the entire series run As a DEVOTED fan of the TV series I can love this movie and the fact that it even got made after HLOTS had been canceled but I would not recommend it to anyone who hasnt had the slightest exposure to the series Now if theyd just release it on DVD,1
A beautiful piece of childrens cinema buried in a world of archaic Celticism Setting the story around the famous Book of Kels believed to have been comprised by monks from the small island of Iona off the western coast of ScotlandTelling the tale of a young abbots apprentice who goes off into the forest in search of CromCruic the fierce headless horseman of pagan mythology In hopes of recovering a lost artefactThe films true beauty lies in its animation Cell shaded in a bright and inspirational style of deep complexity resulting in a look of seem less simplicity Deriving much from the artistic style of the brilliant Cartoon Network series Samurai Jack for its genius use of mark making and background depth The Secret of Kels creates a consistently affective Celtic world living under the shadow of Viking invasionThe history may be intensely inaccurate and the ways of life portrayed lacking realism but these facts are utterly irrelevant as the film sets itself in a world of fantasy and Celticrevivalist mysticism The girl of the forest is a wonderful addition and in my opinion makes the picture what it is as she glides from branch to branch Appearing and disappearing like a mysterious nymph with qualities resembling the legendary Cheshire Cat from Alice and WonderlandThe Secret of Kels is an absolute treat For all genders all ages its a lovely piece of family cinemaDont expect to be awed but instead pleasantly impressed,1
A great movie about triumph over all the naysayers who try to kill your spirit achieving the impossible I wont go on about it other than to say that I liked to reflect on the this film when Im facing something particularly daunting and realize that if Lindberg could do what he did I can certainly face the task before me Definitely a feel good movieSee it You wont be disappointed,1
I have begun to melt so I will make this review as short and sweet as possibleTheres this astronaut and he goes up in a spacecraft with two other guys ya know Except something happens that exposes him to radiation and then when they come backwell never mind what happened to the other guys but our astronaut has begun to melt No not just burn up but MELT Like an ice cream cone in July Well OK maybe not that fast but ya know what I meanAnyway he gets all red gooey and the fact that hes melting makes him really mad I guess he also checked out the melting man handbook because suddenly he knows that in order to keep from totally melting away he has to eat human flesh so he starts ripping people apartThere are other characters but in a movie where a man melts and melts and melts and melts do you really need any others Whats important is WHO will he munch next and WHAT will be left of them HOW long will it take for him to just melt away to nothing WHY was this movie made in the first place WHERE did they get the money WHEN will you fall asleep while watching itIve very nearly melted but I still have enough time left to tell you that this movie is dreadfully boring even though the idea is really cool and kind of gross The makeup is neat but everything else isSPLAT,0
that seem to be fooling people into seeing qualities in this film that are just not thereNear Dark covered the same territory but with much more class and actionwhy the script kept their big secret so long was a total mystery to me I guessed it at the breakfast scene at the start of the film By the time it was revealed to the viewer it was just a case of big deal tell me something I dont knowI found this to be pointless movie that may have challenged the genre conventions unfortunately those conventions are that horror films are tense and packed with genuine sense of horror This was woeful,0
For a movie I was really looking forward to I was very disappointed I had no expectations of this being another Amadeus but did expect a more significant portrayal of Beethovens last yearsThe performance by Ed Harris was superb but the story line was so weak that the film simply moved from one dreary scene to the next with no continuityThe only enjoyable part of the film for me was the performance of the 9th and from that point on I could quite happily have walked out without finishingI left feeling very dissatisfied and still have the feeling that something important was missed,0
It infuriates me no end that now and forever I will have to identify this movie which I consider a masterpiece and I dont use that word lightly with the qualifier Not the Michael Douglas movie Not only are the titles the same but they refer to the same thing the radioactive fallout that rained upon the survivors of the first nuclear bombings In Imamuras film this is no cheap metaphor the whole movie is about the fallout physical and emotional from Hiroshima and the war itself As the deterioration of a couple and their grown niece becomes more grimly clear the ironic imagery becomes more potent from the old clock that is reset each night to the stone gods that gradually pile up outside the heroines door These in turn are carved by a shellshocked veteran who is compelled in a series of tragicomic episodes to attack anything with a motor that approaches the town The bombing day itself is shown in piecemeal flashbacks that are coolly horrifying Yet Black Rain NtMDm can be watched even repeatedly because of Imamuras compassion for his characters I repeat a masterpiece,1
Ill not comment a lot whats to Stereotype characters absolute ignorance about Colombias reality awful mise en scene poor color choice NOT funny it supposed to be a comedy and they expect that you will laugh because some distend music its beside the nonsense scenes Very poor actors direction if you see somewhere those people I mean the interpreters youll know they are at least good but seeing this so call film it is impossible to guess it you get tired of the music this comedy has no rhythm the only good rhythm in it its the rap sing in the final creditspathetic doesnt it etcetc It has been a long time I havent seen a movie so bad,0
Frank Sinatra starred in this odd little short from RKO that is now in the public domain The film came out at about the same time the war ended and is a nice plea for religious toleranceThe film begins with Sinatra on stage singing After leaving the stage he walks out into the alley and finds a group of kids picking on another because of his religion Instead of yelling at the boys or helping them for that matter Sinatra delivers a nice civics lesson on religious toleration and equates prejudice with fascism The kids seem to get the lesson but then out of the blue Sinatra begins singing a song that frankly get it kids would have hated He had a lovely voice but unfortunately I think this detracted from the excellent message he gave to the kids about tolerance Its a case of a good message with too much singingeven if the guy singing is Frank Sinatra Its also an interesting curioa nice historical piece that is often overlookedplus its quite touching even if it seems a bit schmaltzy,1
the intention the directors has for this films are quite honorable but his history of his productions did get me aware that this might not get much to the core like other film makers would do it keeping his great 30 days TV series in mind but also counting in his MTV production i bet you will that opposes his seriousness in any of the matters he documents and also counting in his rather disappointing production supersize me i did not had my hopes up high sadly enough this movie disappointed me none the less as with supersize me after a while i did ask myself what exactly the point of all this was the main statement gets clear enough after half an hour but the rest of the playtime gets filled with rather pointless stuff and rerepeating stuff that were already shown in this way or another earlier in the movie so it wears out and gets extremely boring towards the end,0
Dont even ask me why I watched this The only excuse I can come up with that I was sick with Bronchitis and too weak to change the channel Its too terrible for words the movie that is not the Bronchitis The acting is deplorable Richard Grieco hams it up as a triggerhappy gunslinging serial killer with a penchant for knocking off cops Nick Mancuso phones in a performance as the cop on his trail and Nancy Allen manages to put in the only sympathetic role in the entire film The script is dismal peppered with clichd lines Are you ready Pardner purrs Richard Grieco to every single one of his victims Dire Avoid,0
CQ is incredibly slow and Im a David Mamet fan The movie follows around a young filmmaker who is making a very Barbarellaesque film After that the movie started to lose me Deep and profound Not really The movie Dragonfly being made in CQ has the problem of having no ending This greatly parallels CQ which also lacks an ending in my opinionI was lucky enough to catch this movie at the SxSW film festival I had fairly high expectations having just watched Y Tu Mama Tambien and several other great movies I was also looking forward to Jason Schwartzmans performance But it was not an easy film to get into If youre not into 60s scifi or slow movies that go no where skip itCQ feels like a student film If you want a recent scifiesque indie film rent Donnie Darko it wont put you to sleep,0
Nickelodeon has gone down the toilet They have kids saying things like Oh my God and Were screwedThis show promotes hate for people who arent good looking or arent in the in crowd It say that sexual promiscuity is alright by having girls slobbering over shirtless boys Not to mention the overweight boy who takes off his shirt The main characters basically shun anyone out of the ordinary Carlys friend Sam who may be a lesbian beats the snot out of anybody that crosses her path which says its alright to be a bch This show has so much negativity in it that nobody should watch it I give it a 0 out of 10,0
Oftentimes films of this nature come across as a mixed bag of great work along with slight drivel to fill the runtime Whether it be the big name support or the project itself Paris je taime never falls into this realm I believe I can truly say that the movie as a whole is better than its parts Between the wonderful transitions and the fantastic ending sequence merging characters together in one last view of love in Paris I think the film would have suffered if any cog was removed True there are definitely a few standouts that overshadow the rest but in the end I have a lasting image even if just a split second of each short vignette Love takes many forms and the talent here rises to the occasion to surprise and move the audience through shear poetry and elegance of the emotions many facetsQuartier des Enfants Rouges Maggie Gyllenhaal surprises as a drugaddled actress shooting in Paris and meeting with her dealer The reveal at its conclusion leaves you a bit off balance as the infatuation between the two changes handsQuatier Latin Ben Gazzara and Gena Rowlands recreating a relationship from an old Cassavettes film bring some great sharp wit and sarcasm as they meet to discuss their impending divorce What of their conversation is true and what is just to anger the other it is all enjoyable leaving a smile on your faceQuais de Seine Director Gurinder Chadha gives us a touching portrait of love existing beyond religious and racial differences It is a sweet little story of shy love between two people obviously feeling a connection but unable to quite vocalize itTour Eiffel I will admit to being disappointed that Sylvain Chomet did not get an animated sequence together however this live action tale of mimes falling in love at a Paris jail has the same quirky nature as his film Les Triplettes de BellevilleTuileries The Coen Brothers stick to their strange sense of humor and deliver some fine laughs Steve Buscemi really shines and sells the performance without speaking a word His facial reactions to the verbal abuse of a disgruntled Frenchman are pricelessBastille Here is a heartbreaking portrait of a couple about out of love only to have it come back in the face of tragedy Sergio Castellitto and Miranda Richardson a moving as the couple dealing with trouble and finding how strong the bond of true love isPreLachaise A surprisingly funny little tale from horror master Wes Craven A little Oscar Wilde humor can add levity to any relationshipParc Monceau Alfonso Cuarn looks to be practicing the amazing longtakes he perfects in Children of Men with this tale of two people in love walking down the street As Nick Nolte and Ludivine Sagnier eventually come into closeup view we also find the true context of their conversation of forbidden lovePorte de Choisy A very surreal look into the glamour of Paris This is probably the most odd entry but so intriguing that you cant look away from the craziness that ensues Do not anger

fire kindledQuartier de la Madeleine Even vampires in Paris can find love amongst the feeding hours I dont know whether to be happy for Elijah Wood as a result or not Beautifully shot and muted to allow the vibrancy of the blood red this short is strange but then so is love14th arrondissement Leave it to Alexander Paynes odd sense of humor to really add some depth to this voiceover story told of an American in Paris to find what love is Her harsh uneducated French is a very stark contrast to the authentic accents weve been listening to until this pointjust offkilter enough to be both funny and totally true to the storyMontmartre An interesting introduction into the proceedings Paris can be a city reviled for everyday activities like finding a parking spot yet when love is discovered it will take its prisoner anywhere to continue the journeyLoin du 16me Catalina Sandino Moreno brilliantly shows what love for a child is through her subtle performance as the tale is bookended by her singing to a young child yet totally different each timePlace des Fetes My favorite tale of the bunch Seydou Boro and Assa Maga are simply fantastic The cyclical nature of the story and how fate brings the two characters together twice in order for Boro to finally ask her for coffee is tough to watch Sometimes love at your final moment is enough to accept ones leaving of this earthPlace des

Beslon reminisces trying to find where they went wrong through a series of sharp quick cuts from his meeting Natalie Portman to eventually seeing how much he needs herLe Marais Leave it to Gus Van Sant to show us a story about the gap in communication and understanding as his films almost always deal with some form of alienation His photographer from Elephant is an American working in Paris who

When I was little my parents took me along to the theater to see Interiors It was one of many movies I watched with my parents but this was the only one we walked out of Since then I had never seen Interiors until just recently and I could have lived out the rest of my life without it What a pretentious ponderous and painfully boring piece of 70s wine and cheese tripe Woody Allen is one of my favorite directors but Interiors is by far the worst piece of crap of his career In the unmistakable style of Ingmar Berman Allen gives us a dark angular muted insight in to the lives of a family wrought by the psychological damage caused by divorce estrangement career love nonlove halitosis whatever The film intentionally has no comic relief no music and is drenched in shadowy pathos This film style can be best defined as expressionist in nature using an improvisational method of dialogue to illicit a more pronounced depth of meaning and truth But Woody Allen is no Ingmar Bergman The film is painfully slow and dull But beyond that I simply had no connection with or sympathy for any of the characters Instead I felt only contempt for this parade of shuffling whining nicotine stained martyrs in a perpetual quest for identity Amid a backdrop of cosmopolitan affluence and baked Brie intelligentsia the story looms like a fart in the room Everyone speaks in affected platitudes and elevated language between cigarettes Everyone is lost and struggling desperate to find direction or understanding or whatever and it just goes on and on to the point where you just want to slap all of them Its never about resolution its only about interminable introspective babble It is nothing more than a psychological drama taken to an extreme beyond the audiences ability to connect Woody Allen chose to make characters so immersed in themselves we feel left out And for that reason I found this movie painfully self indulgent and spiritually draining I see what he was going for but his insistence on promoting his message through Prozac prose and distorted film techniques jettisons it past the point of relevance I highly recommend this one if youre feeling a little too happy and need something to remind you of death Otherwise lets just pretend this film never happened,0
Ed Gein one of the most famous serial killers of all time he was the inspiration for famous movie killers like Norman Bates Leatherface and Buffalo Bill He is also one of the most sick and disturbing killers of all time I watched a documentary on him so I know his story pretty well When I saw this I was curious because I thought it was supposed to be like a documentary reenactment but I have to say that this was just a pathetic waste of time First off the facts are completely wrong with a few minor exceptions and secondly this was just a stupid Hollywood story when these horrific murders really happened and they just made it into a cheap buck Not to mention that if they were going to make it into a horror movie this was poorly acted Ed Gein he lives in a small town in Wisconsin called Plainfield but he has a little secret that the whole town is being effected by he digs up dead bodies as well as brutally murdering people Bobby a deputy is on the case to get Ed Gein only no one knows who the killer is at first just finding crime scene after crime scene But things get personal when Ed starts messing with the policemens family and friendsOf course this movie was just ridicules and completely insulting to the true story I always thought that bad acting is a necessary tool to a horror flick but for this story it should have been a better acted film not to mention it should have been more of a documentary than a stupid clichd horror film Please stay away from this film its completely pathetic and untrue to the story of Ed Gein110,0

As a semifilm buff I had heard of this infamous movie a long time ago I had heard that it was basically a 15 million dollar film about the tyrannical rule of the Roman emperor Caligula complete with hardcore pornography What struck me was that it was a porno movie yet it had great thespians like Peter OToole John Geilgud Malcolm McDowell and Hellen Mirren in it A week ago I saw a documentary about Caligula on the History channel and this film came back into my head and finally my curiousity got the best of me I foolishly rented the DVD and even more foolishly watched itWithin the first 30 minutes I was seeing acts of sex and especially violence that would earn an NC17 even by todays standards Was it really necessary to have a scene of a man having his urinary track closed and then have gallons of wine poured into him and then have his stomach cut with a sword all in very graphic detail And a scene where a guy gets his d cut off and fed to dogs again in very graphic detailand this just scratches the surface The argument for this movie from those who like it seems that it is the only film that honestly portrays pagan Rome and its excesses When in fact what this movie really is is sheer exploitation From beginning to end you see nothing but endless torture and decapitations and every kind of violence and crude behavior imaginable sadomasochism rape necrophelia it just never stopped There is no insight into Caligula himself what might have propelled him to go mad the horrible childhood he had that molded him into a sadist as an adult This is not a historic film it is sleaze Even the porn in this movie stinks and through much of this when I wasnt gagging I was just incredibly bored By the time it was over I was depressed didnt feel much like eating and this movie does the impossible it actually can turn you off of sexWhat were these great actors thinking when they got into this I did read that the porn segments were filmed after the principal shooting was completed which explains why none of the main actors are in any of these scenes and why the quality of these scenes is so poor But still and all these actors must have known what they were getting into Right at the opening credits it says Penthouse Magazine and Bob Gucionne Presents And the scenes that the famous actors actually take part in are completely repulsive in and of themselves Apparently director Tinto Brass wanted his name removed from the completed film entirely as did the screenwriter Gore Vidal of all people Even John Geilgud and Peter Otoole were begging people not to see this when it opened at the Cannes film festivalFor the amount of money the producers spent on this the movies quality is terrible Everything is underlit and murky as if the film was dropped in a swamp prior to being developed and thats when youre lucky enough to view a scene thats actually infocus The sound is poorly dubbed much of the music is awkward and the editing is god awfulAnyway I brought this movie on myself My advicedont watch this dont watch this dont watch thisas for myself tomorrow night I am going to watch something lighterlike DAWN OF THE DEAD,0
Annie Potts is the only highlight in this truly dull film Mark Hamill plays a teenager who is really really really upset that someone stole the Corvette he and his classmates turned into a hotrod quite possibly the ugliest looking car to be featured in a movie and heads off to Las Vegas with Annie to track down the evil genius who has stolen his pride and joyI would have plucked out my eyes after watching this if it wasnt for the fun of watching Annie Potts in a very early role and its too bad for Hamill that he didnt take a few acting lessons from her Danny Bonaduce also makes a goofy cameo,0
Ive read a few of the reviews and Im kinda sad that a lot of the Story seems glossed over Its easy to do because its not a Book its a movie and theres only so much that can be done in a movie US Or Canadian or anywhereColm Feore does at least for a recovering FgHag like myself a great job of not only playing the friendly neighborhood gay man but playing sick I mean the man really cant get much more pale Though you might never know it from the strip down near the um endIf you need decrepit there are a few SKing movies you might likeBeing the daughter of a Recovering Alchoholic the druggie brother David Cubitt was the trick for me Im going to give him cred he grew up quick and believe me thats good And as an Aspiring writer moimeme I can dig a lot of his insights and overviews But Im more prosy than poeticI may be easy to please but I enjoyed it A nice story pretty well put together by Canadians quelle surprise Just toed the line of the Movie of the week missing it by not being as drawn out GREATLY Appreciated And it was rather cleverly portrayed,1
This film was enjoyable but for the wrong reasons The coordination of the action sequences are laughable and make the film have some funny slap stick moments Robert Ginty and Fred Williamson have a memorable scene together near the end where Williamson says to Ginty you sure do get around buddy boy I did enjoy this film only for Ginty and Williamson but not for the storyline that must have been written on the back of a napkin in four lines and the rest adlibbed most likely A film with over 30 parts only has a credit list for 10 or so It seems odd that no one else has a credit in the film maybe they had some insight into how the finished product would look The one thing this film does have going for it is that it is quite violent so that tripled with Fred Williamson and Robert Ginty make for a film worth seeing,1
It was a terrific movie I like to watch it again and again The actors were awesome The movie kept me on the edge of my seat I would recommend this movie to anyone I wish Lifetime would put this movie on DVD I would most definitely purchase a copy This movie just proves that you should be very careful about who you get hooked up with You may think you know someone but you never know My daughter watched the movie with me She thought it was great All I know is I will watch this movie every time Lifetime airs it Its the kind of movie that keeps you glued to the tvI wish Lifetime would redo the movie but use the same actors and bring it to the big screen,1
For those who think of Dame May Witty as the kindly slightly batty old lady from Hitchcocks The Lady Vanishes this movie requires an adjustment Here shes anything but kindly or batty Instead her son George Macready is the loony one Just dont give him a knife otherwise his eyes light up and no furniture cushion in the house is safe Now we know what he has in mind for the trapped Nina Foch if he can just get out from under Mothers domineering handReally tight little womanindanger film that keeps the suspense on high throughout The script never strays from Fochs dilemma Shes held prisoner in a big old Gothic house on the edge of an angry sea Theyre going to kill her but why Her predicament makes no sense The tension mounts as she tries one escape ploy after another but even strangers seem against her We begin to feel her helplessness and mounting paranoia as the world turns away from herDirector Joseph H Lewis took a big step toward cult status with this film and understandably so Then too watch Foch run subtly through a gamut of emotions without once going over the top Witty too shines as a really intimidating matriarch who knows what she wants and how to get it if she can just keep her wacko son in line My one reservation is the climax which seems too contrived considering the timing of the events Nonetheless its a good nervewracking way to spend a little over an hour courtesy Columbia studios,1
Brian Keith as Cole Wlikerson and Richard Jaeckel as Wade Matlock make excellent villains They just love intimidating the locals in the most brutal way possible and sneer sexily at any suggestion that there might be a more humane way to achieve their ends Its a pity that goodygoody Glenn Ford gets in their way,1
I really liked this quirky movie The characters are not the bland beautiful people that show up in so many movies and on TV It has a realistic edge with a captivating story line The main title sequence alone makes this movie fun to watch,0
Boyle Heights Los Angeles legendary South American goatsucking vampire El Chupacabra is on the loose feeding on anyone unlucky enough to cross its path Animal control officer Navarro Eric Alegria and Chupacabra expertauthor Starlina Divide Elina Madison attempt to track down the creature but find their progress hampered by a pair of dumb cops money hungry locals keen to capture the beast for a fat reward and a couple of nefarious scientists who want the monster for their experimentsStinking higher than a twoweekold taco El Chupacabra is an incredibly bad horror movie that even fans of incredibly bad horror movies might struggle to sit through With its dreadful script awful direction by not one but two talentless hacksBrennon Jones and Paul Wynne laughable dialogue and some of the worst acting this side of a porn flick I recommend this film about as much as I do drinking the tap water in MexicoAs Navarro and Starlina proceed with their investigations viewers are treated to some incredibly weak gore the worst designed book jacket in history the most unconvincing dead person Ive seen since the blinking corpse in Dr Butcher MD and a hightech computerised security system consisting of a keyboard nailed to a postTo be fair for a guy in a rubber suit the monster itself is fairly creepy hairy with big claws and a face like a particularly ugly bat but its appearances are few and far between with more screen time spent on the tedious trials and tribulations of whiney Officer Navarro than on the killer antics of the titular creature just how many times is it necessary to see Navarro handing in paperwork to his bitchy bossIf like me you make the mistake of wasting your hardearned cash on this dreadful latino bilge in my case it was a whole 50p consider using the disc as a coaster for your tequila rather than actually watching it,0
Its so sad that Romanian audiences are still populated with vulgar and uneducated individuals who relish this kind of cheap and demonstrative shows as superficial and brutal as the Garcea series or the Vacanta mare childplays The difference is that Mugur Mihescu Doru Octavian Dumitru and other such subartisans never presume to claim their shows as art Pintilie who 40 years ago made a very good movie Duminic la ora sase followed by another one nice enough Reconstituirea tries to declare his filmlenghts art works but unfortunately he masters at a way too limited level the specifically cinematographic means of expression As such Niki Ardelean offers again a sample of HOW NOT this being about its only merit,0
Pola X is a beautiful adaption of Herman Melvilles Pierre or the Ambiguities The comments on here surprise me it makes me wonder what has led to the overwhelmingly negative reaction The shock value is the least appealing thing about this film a minor detail that has been blown out of proportion The story is of Pierres downfall and the subsequent destruction of those around him which is overtly demonstrated in his features demeanour and idiolect The dialogue and soundtrack set this film apart from any other I have seen and turn a fundamentally traditional storyline with controversial twists into an unforgettably emotional epicI cant stress enough the importance of disregarding everything you have heard about this film and watching as I did with an open mind You will I hope be rewarded in the same way that I was I felt on edge and nervous from around the halfhour mark however the film is far from scary in any traditional sense It will leave you with 1000 thoughts each of them at once troublesome and thrilling I know Im gushing here but I feel the need to make up for the negative perception of this film Its the best Ive seen all year,1
This early Sirk melodrama shot in black and white is a minor film yet showcases the flair of the German director in enhancing tired story lines into something resembling art Set in the 1910s Barbara Stanwyck is the woman who has sinned by abandoning her smalltown husband and family for the lure of the Chicago stage She never fulfilled her ambitions and is drawn back to the town she left by an eager letter from her daughter informing her that she too has taken a liking to the theatre a high school production that is Back in her old town she once again comes up against smallmindedness and has to deal with her hostile eldest daughter bewildered and boring husband Richard Carlson and exlover The plot is nothing new but Sirk sets himself apart by creating meaningful compositions with every frame carefully shot and he is aided immeasurably by having Stanwyck as his leading lady It runs a crisp 76 minutes and thats just as well because the material doesnt really have the legs to go any further,1
I first saw Heimat 2 on BBC2 in the 90s when I was at art college living and moving among artists and musicians hoping for future success So The Second Home of friendships made after leaving the familial home of striving for a professional excellence strongly resonated with my living reality I was captivated by the characters the storytelling the lyrical camerawork and above all by the music In it I could divine the beginnings of German Electronic music of 50s Stockhausen Kraftwerk Can Neue Faust of the 70s the sound experiments of John Cage Walter Carlos and the British electronic psychedelia of The White Noise The soundtrack composer Nikos Mamangakis studied with Carl Orff of Carmina Buranafame so I found its tastes contemporary to the Electronic Pop Sound Effects worldI hadnt seen Heimat or Heimat 3 so I watched it as a whole in itself without a before or after As someone else has commented it is both epic and lyrical historical and artistic Many favourite moments including the wonderful voice of Gisela Muller Evelyn the Bach marimba of Daniel Smith Juan the pianoplaying of Henry Arnold Hermann and the celloplaying of Salome Kammer ClarissaI could write more but its already been said here Why cant British or US TV PRODUCE SUCH MASTERPIECES The Wire had the realism and politics and epic sweep of a city David Lynch and Dennis Potter had imaginative tropes to their serialised TV work too but this is arthouse and soap at its most cinematic and narrative sublime Its never included in critics choices of Best Films but it should be Still as poetic and powerful as when I first saw it over 17 years ago I watch the 3 boxed sets every autumn for their mellow fruitfulness Inspired and inspiring,1
A remarkable documentary about the landmark achievements of the Women Lawyers Association WLA of Kumba in southwest Cameroon in legally safeguarding the rights of women and children from acts of domestic violence In this Muslim culture where men have always been sovereign over women according to Sharia law one can well imagine the difficulty of imposing secular legal rights for women and children After 17 years of failed efforts leaders of the WLA began recently to score a few wins and the purpose of this film is to share these victorious storiesThe leaders of this legal reform movement are Vera Ngassa a state prosecutor and Beatrice Ntuba a senior judge Court President Both play themselves in this film which may contain footage shot spontaneously though I imagine much of it if not all consists of subsequent recreations of real events for the camera Four cases are reviewed and all of the plaintiffs also play themselves in the filmTwo cases involve repeated wife beating with forcible sex in one case another involves forced sex upon a 10 year old girl and yet another concerns the repeated beatings of a child age 8 by an aunt One of the beaten wives also is seeking a divorce We follow the cases from the investigation of complaints to the outcomes of the trials The outcomes in each case are favorable to the women and children The perpetrators receive stiff prison terms andor fines the divorce is grantedThe aggressive prosecution of the child beating aunt demonstrates that these female criminal justice officials are indeed genderneutral when it comes to enforcing the law Also noteworthy is the respect with which all parties including those found guilty are treated This is a highly important and well made film Of interest is the fact that one of the directors Ms Longinotto also codirected the 1998 film Divorce Iranian Style which dealt with related themes in Tehran In broken English with English subtitles My Grade B 810,1
At first sight this is yet another highschool anime with lots of excuses for fanservice but there is a lot more going on The fanservice is part of the plot the main character is a tired cynic unusual and most importantly there is a clever plot that ties all the episodes together and that poses some interesting questions The episodes are deliberately nonchronological and it is certainly worth watching the series again in chronological orderThe series is worth watching carefully because there are a lot of casual hints in there that foreshadow and explain things plus a good number of injokes about other series anime and other,1
We viewed the vcr and found it to be fascinating Not knowing anything about this true story I thought Oh no PBrosnan as an American Indian red Indian in the film what a bad choice until I discovered the truth about Grey Owl The film does a good job of demonstrating the dignity of these native peoples and undermining the racist myths about them And Annie Galipeau WOW what a beauty and very convincing as an Indian woman I believe she is FrenchCanadian she sure reverts to the alltoo familiar speech of such In spite of Brosnans detached grunting style in the end he comes through convincingly as a passionate dedicated man The plot is a little weak in demostrating his conversion from trapper to animal coservationist Good film highly recommended,1
I can see little girls enjoying this show but calling this a family show is ridiculous Im amazed how well remembered it is after all these years Its an extremely unfunny and stupid show about widowed father of three living with his dead wifes brother and his stupid friend from school and others as the seasons go on All of the plot lines generally have a really dumb lesson In the middle of each episode somebody is mad at somebody else and each episode they make up and it ends on a light unfunny joke As for the actors I didnt like them either Bob Saget was painfully unfunny as the dad with the mom responsibilities Dave Coulier is a one note joke 30 something year old that does cartoon voices and acts like a kid and hes horrid John Stamos was the most tolerable character but he was so clichd it was hard to watch him The oldest girl DJ on the show was a genuinely bad actress and showed no emotion ever The middle girl Stephanie was too clichd as the annoying little sister The youngest girl Michelle showed what bad actresses the Olsen twins were You can always tell when they are switching them off The plot lines to too many story lines were so unrealistically stupid its cringe worthy This is a family show that tried to replace any good substance with cuteness and love and though those are needed for a show about a family they overdid it way too much This will be remembered as my least favorite sitcom from the 80s and 90sMy rating Terrible show TVG 30 mins,0
This movie is just plain bad Weak story weak directing and below average acting The thing that really irritated me was the blatant advertising constantly for a well known internet provider It is obvious some scenes are written to do just that advertising This movie is a slap in the face to anyone who payed money for thisDo not watch this it not worth your time,0
This comedy has some tolerably funny stuff in it surrounded by a lot of unfunny stuff Just about every scene involving the servants of the castle and their silly antics is a waste of time And the plotting is so sloppy that it makes you wonder if they actually had a script ready before they started filming this or they were simply making it all up as they went along 12,0
The original Australian Kath Kim is brilliant Why do American producers need to remake ruin yet another classic show Remember the original version of The Office with Ricky Gervais It was an absolute masterpiece and there was no need to remake it The producers said that the British humour from The Office and the Australian humour from Kath Kim would not translate to an American audience WHAT So basically they are saying that Americans are too dumb and stupid to understand the jokes so they need to remake the shows with overthetop childish gags so that the Americans can understand the humour The original Australian version of Kath Kim is fantastic and very funny Avoid the American version like the plague,0
In my Lit class weve just finished the book Hatchet and this movie is nothing like the book 1 Brian never ate worms in the book 2 He didnt know the pilots name 3 His mom was cheating on his father in a station wagon not in the woods where anyone could see 4 The man the mother is cheating with doesnt have black hair he has blonde Now for the unrealistic parts of the movie 1 A thirteen year old cant punch his fist through a window in one punch And for the acting the kid who played Brian was a horrible actor However I do believe that the scenery was impressive though I highly doubt the director even read the bookThis movie is good if you have not read the book Hatchet by Gary Paulsen but if you have then begin a complaint letter to the director,0
This seventh yes you read right the seventh Puppet Master movie shows how the demented group of dolls came to be by a french puppeteer who uses them to get revenge on a group of ancient mummies who are after him once they learn that he holds the secret to life It was taught to him by a sorcerer also on the run before he died He used this power to bring normal puppets to life This sequel is basically nonsense sprinkled upon even more nonsense like most of the Puppet Master sequels Due to the PG13 rating we dont even get any entertaining puppet murders Come to think of it there are NO damn puppet murders If there was one franchise that needed to be cut off it would be this one No moregod please no more,0

I thought maybe maybe this could be good An early appearance by the ReAnimator Jeffery Combs many homages to old horror movies the Troma label on the front this movie could be a gem I thought wrongFrightmare is a boring overplayed half assed homage to the fright films of yore The story is an old one young people breaking into a house getting drunk making love and tampering with things that shouldnt be tampered with The oft recycled slasher film formula is used here this time with a thought to be dead actor named Conrad Radzoff doing the killing In fact the performance by the Radzoffs actor Ferdy Mayne is the only redeeming quality of this film He does the snooty Dracula style character very well But as for the kids its not so good with Combs only having a minimal partThe film lacks entertainment value and only features one cool character and one or two scenes that can hold your attention I do not recommend this film unless you are desperate for something to watch and this is the only movie left at blockbuster,0

Not much to say beyond the summary save that this is an example of J Edgars Hoovers constant attention to maintaining a good PR profile They dont make movies this bad very often especially with the likes of Jimmy Stewart and Vera Miles in the blend Too bad,0
Christian PropagandaLots of fear mongeringThis is not SciFi this is ChriFi Christian fictionThe movie started out OK but took a sharp Christian right turn From then on it was all about god jc the holy bible and the devil The ufos are really just demonic deception to fool people in to believing that there is other intelligent life in the universe Satans idea is to trick you in to thinking that there could be more to life than what is in the bibleThe abductions could be used to explain away the rapture The people left behind would believe it was a mass alien abduction instead of god taking all the Christians to heaven No reason to repent if its aliens The deeper message in the movie is that if you dont believe in god and have jc in your life than you believe in nothing and your life has no purpose,0
Saw a trailer for this on another video and decided to rent when it came out Boy was I disappointed The story is extremely boring the acting aside from Christopher Walken is bad and I couldnt care less about the characters aside from really wanting to see Noras husband get thrashed Christopher Walkens role is such a throwaway what a tease,0
That 70s Show is definitely the funniest show currently on TV I started watching it about two and a half years ago and as soon as I saw it I could tell it was a great show I like all the characters but my personal favorites are Fez and Kelso Leo was also an awesome character while he was there I really hope he comes back because hes hilarious Its classic when Fez goes you son of a bitch and when Kelso yells burn that always makes me laugh They are both great characters and always have something funny to say Jackie being hot is just another reason to watch the show she started out being really good looking but damn somewhere around season 56 she just got Really hot Ive seen most of the episodes more than once some like 10 times and there still hilarious This is one of the few shows that I can watch over and over and still laugh at just as much as I did the first time I saw it The cast is classic almost everyone is funny where with many shows there are only a few funny characters I will be sad to see this show end next year but it will be going off the air as one of the best shows ever,1
In the DVD era you would think you could find pretty much any piece of crap committed to celluloid and for the most part its true So WHY WHY is it so hard to find this great little flick clearly done by people who love noir as a loving homage buit never descending into spoof land of that most cinematic of genres Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman are a HOOT in this and superstarinthemaking Carla Gugino KAREN SISCO SIN CITY does her now trademark red hot babegreat acting routine This movie really has it all for fans of film A b noir on steroids the clever and steamy JUDAS KISS succeeds on every countPlease Columbia TriStar PLEASE release it on DVD soon,1
Warner Brothers produced this 3D extravaganza that was the biggest commercial success for westerns in 1953 Guy Madison leads a band of guardhouse soldiers and misfits to rescue two white women being held by Indians which essentially all there is to this film The 3D format was in its early stages as a Hollywood gimmick to compete with the growing popularity of home television and the effects work very well here The rescuers make off with the ladies and are pursued by the Indians until the white men make their stand at an island in a creek bed The Indian weaponry comes at the audience nonstop throughout and a spray of tobacco juice aimed at a rattler is thrown in for good measure Madison was quite popular as televisions Wild Bill Hickock and is good as a displaced cattle rancher who is given his thankless task by the army For all the films polish and presentation the movie was made in just three days,1
The Best Years of Our Life is often compared to Its a Wonderful Life They never should be Their only commonality is the desire to make a serious comment about a war that took millions of lives It is hard to know what value individual life may have How many people know that 1 in 22 people lost their lives violently in the last century What a statistic we have to live with Also our feelings about war have changed in 60 years We have progressively moved from thinking that war is just if the enemy is the right one to believing that no war is totally just especially the ones that have been fought recentlyI have been a life long pacifist I oppose all war Not long ago I had that position tested It occurred while I was on the USS Lexington which is permanently anchored in Corpus Christi Texas The ship required a crew that is 3 or 4times the community in which I live It is a powerful experience moving around on her decks She had seen a great deal of action Someone granted me the right to be a pacifist and it was not cheaply boughtI cannot watch The Best Years of Our Life without thinking about things like the LexingtonEach of the three veterans paid their dues And they paid mine as wellNo one of them got off any easier than any other The Navy Air Force and Army paid equally although in different ways Each had problems directly related to the war And each had to work terribly hard to overcome those difficulties It took more courage to face their civilian surroundings than it did to deal with war because each had to do it on his own Each could understand and sympathize with the problem of the others ultimately no one could helpThe moving part of the film this could be the beginning part of the spoiler is what follows when one of the male leads found someone who knew enough to give advice The obvious case is when Derry told Herald to marry the girl Dont hesitate do it tomorrow It is hard for Harold to believe that anyone could love him when he had been a football hero and athletic star before the war But to his credit Harold listensThe other is when Al tells Derry to stay away from his daughter The meaning was clear Mend your relationship with your wife standard fair for 30s40s films Derry did not debate the point he felt he was not fit for Als daughter So he agreed The truth of the film comes out when we consider the daughter feels the same way about Derry Real emotions from real people I think our era has deep problems with feelings and sentiment and honor I sometimes think we believe these values do not exist Thats perhaps why people looking at this film have problemsAl is not free of advice he does not totally want Any time his boss talks to him Al gets tied in knots And rightly so There are some things that cannot be judged by the standards of occupation they must be judged by huge general intangibles and only someone tested by the severities of life would understand what those intangibles areAll of this leads up to a scene near the end where all the planes that fought so valiantly are stripped stacked stored discarded and soon to be recycled their function worth and pride as translucent as Derry himself He can overcome that translucency which he does making him fit in his mind for the woman he lovesI gave The Best Years of Our Lives a 10 and there are few films I feel that way about This is not a film for popcorn It deserves our attention We are very privileged to eves drop on something so private as the lives of these wonderful people We ought to be careful that we dont abuse that privilege,1
This movie probably would only get a 7 or 8 from me to tell the truth if I had seen trailers or had any kind of knowledge of what the film is all about Since it was virtually all a surprise it was almost a perfect piece of edgy entertainment that gets a strong 9 from meI read through some of the comments briefly and saw that someone else had almost the same experience as me and he advised to just watch it It was good advice Read the rest at your own risk of spoilingEva Mendez plays a headstrong successstarved network TV programmer that took a joke made by a coworker while brainstorming TV program ideas about Russian Roulette seriously The story follows her in a documentary style on her pursuit to make this happen,1
If you are a fan of Zorro Indiana Jones or action in general this is a mustsee Directed by Republics ace team of William Witney and John English and starring Reed Hadley as Don DiegoZorro this serial delivers I wont bore you with the plot who cares less talking more fighting what really matters here is Hadleys superb interpretation of the characters and the stunt work of Dale van Sickel and Yakima Canutt STUNT SPOILERS FOLLOW You can see the influence this film had on Lucas and Spielberg Zorro gets caught in the original version of the Star Wars trash compactor in one chapter trapped on a rope bridge ala Temple of Doom in another does a Raiders horsetocoach transfer and even flees through a tunnel while the baddies knock over a huge water tank and flood the tunnel behind him exactly as Mola Ram does to Indy in Temple of Doom In addition to all this the whip action is great as Zorro disarms villains swings to safety etc with his trusty lash Most of the sword work is fair to lame except for chapter one which features a terrific sword brawl in a cantina choreographed by swordstunt legend Ralph Faulkner who makes a rare screen appearance as the evil Rodriguez This was the first serial I ever saw on Matine at the Bijou when I was a kid and I have been hooked on them ever since Zorros Fighting Legion delivers Z goods,1
Chupacabra Terror is saved from a 1 by the presence of Canadian cutie Chelan Simmons as the heroine She is a delight to watch from the front back and side Otherwise what you have here is your standard monster movie playing like a lowbudget shipboard version of THE RELIC John RhysDavies plays the captain of the ship on which the monster is being transported And the very nonscary monster is simply a man in a suit He does commit about 100 senseless gory killings at least so the body count in this one is pretty awesome Formulaic to say the least I love the moment when Simmons ominously tells someone what chupacabra stands for Goat eater Oooohhhscary,0
I cant figure Al Pacino out I watch him in the Godfather Scarface Carlitos Way and I think I am watching one of the greatest actors of the last thirty years Then I see him in Two for the Money Any Given Sunday and Revolution and I wonder what the guy is thinkingI stumbled on Revolution a few nights ago and thought I would invest the next two hours on this Here is a news flash Want to get prisoners to talk Force them to watch this over and overtheyll confess to anythingI wont rehash the plot since there is no coherent plot but it does take place during the American Revolution and Pacino plays an uneducated peasant who does not want to get involved but ultimately does While he has no money no education and dresses like a caveman a very hot Natasha Kinski falls in love with him for no apparent reason since they have only two minutes of dialogue togetherQuite frankly if Al Smith starred in this movie instead of Al Pacino it would have ruined their career The script was horrible but Pacinos demotivated performance and obvious fake accent made it even worse Donald Sutherlands role was laughable I really cant describe it Natasha Kinski is a main character but has like 5 lines in the movie In fact nobody speaks much in this movieOne of the most laughable premise in the movie is how Al Pacino and Kinski have this uncanny knack to continually run into each other on the battlefield Its like the entire Northeast is a Starbucks Hey funny to see you here again on ANOTHER battlefield 100 miles awaysee you in a few monthsI am required to give this one star by IMDb since there is nothing here for a negative score,0
After watching StopLoss I find myself against disappointed in Hollywood for making such a stinker Gone are the days of glory of the films of the 1940s that made one proud to be an American fighting the evilness that desires conquest abroad and death at home What we are left with is dribble frothing at the mouth of rabid antiBush radicals The story tells of three young men who return home from the war One descends into outofcontrol madness culminating in his death The main protagonist deserts his country at a time of war and destroys his best friends relationship with his fianc at the same time The third truly is the hero of the story electing to continue the fight that was brought to our shores nearly eight years ago What makes this movie bad is not the acting but the premise behind it We are lead to believe that decorated soldiers are in fact haters of our country Desertion is akin to treason in a time of war and the main protagonist flirts with it throughout the movie This paradox is designed to weaken the audiences reaction to the central act of the movie We are not supposed to find fault with King since he wears medals but his actions dont just merit it but cry out for it He is not an antihero In order to accept the movie the audience must accept the correctness of desertion because the story paints King as nothing else short of a hero I cannot accept that since it is like asking me to call the sky yellow on a clear blue day Furthermore derision for the real hero is heaped upon the man who reenlists and continues to serve his country I would only recommend this stinker to someone who needs convincing of the decay of Hollywood as it is a clear example of it No wonder it fared poorly in the box office,0
When I saw this movie first it was long ago on VHSVideo I did like this movie because it was funny and excitingly Some years ago I saw another movie called Andy Colbys Incredible Adventure In this movie were parts of Wizards of the lost kingdom used in They called this movie KOR the conquerer I began to search for the KORMovie many years because I wanted to see the complete movie not only the parts which were used in the Andy ColbyMovie No shop had this KorMovie to rent and no shop did know this movie Many years I watched my old VHStapes I had at home and what a wonder I had this movie since many years still at home but the movie had a different title because in Germany it has 3 or 4 titles So I was happy to find this tape at home and this time I had much more time in watching KOR the Conquerer again The music is great during the hole movie but the best part of filming in combination with the music is this moment when KOR is walking drunken through the green forrest The music in the background had some kind of magic I like Bo Svenson and also the boy who played Simon in the movie Both of them did their job very good Manfred Kraatz Germany 26102004 Thanks to all for reading my comment,1
When the long running Happy Ever After came to an end its characters Terry June Fletcher were revived for the longer running and more popular sequel Terry June although their surnames were changed from Fletcher to MedfordTerry has received a new job and as a result he and June move to Purley where they end up in all manner of scrapes unwanted guests dropping by to visit at an inconvenient moment the boss inviting himself to dinner and Terry trying to chance his arm at DIY but cocking it up each time A fellow IMDb user branded this show as not clever and never well written Fair enough it wasnt clever but that was the whole point As for never well written some of the episodes were pretty substandard I will admit but overall I found it to be extremely well written highly amusing and very well actedIt was warm hearted slapstick not dissimilar to the later BBC sitcom Keeping Up Appearances Eight different writers contributed to the nine series giving the show plenty of scope Terry Scott was a comic genius as he well proved in productions such as Hugh I the Carry On films and of course here June Whitfield likewise was a comedy legend in her own rightI enjoy some modern shows ie Still Game The Catherine Tate Show Legit and Empty I even enjoyed the alternative comedy Naked Video The Young Ones and The Comic Strip Presents but I am more inclined to enjoy vintage comedy such as this Humour that you dont need to think about is excellent for when you are feeling down and want to lift yourself up For the record Terry June was wonderful stuff Special note should be made of the catchy theme tune which caught the mood of the show tremendously well,1
I watched Speak Easily one night and thought it was ok but missing something Maybe Buster Keaton strangely speaking threw me off or the labored line delivery of a leading lady The next day I kept thinking about the movie though I couldnt get Durantes song out of my head I kept trying to better remember Thelma Todds first scene I considered that maybe Keaton did do some funny falls and physical comedy The next night I watched a scene with Thelma Todd as a conniving chorus girl trying to impress Buster and Jimmy with her sex appeal A very funny scene the actors excellent their faces their eyes their silly expressions So I watched another scene their show is opening on Broadway Buster in his blissful innocence botches every act Again I was laughing out loud appreciating Keatons clowning and tumbling So the next night I watched the whole movie again and this time I see it for the first time Its Stupendous Its Sensational Its Sublime Three great comedians Todd dances Durante sings Keaton speaks Sure it aint poifectbut theres a lot of laughs in this picture,1
Well this film is a difficult one really To be straight with you this film doesnt contain much of a riveting story nore does it make u want to know how itll endbut Ill tell you something nownever have I been as tense and jumped up before in my life This film sure does deliver the jumps and thrills To be fair I did watch it at almost midnight so I was kinda sleepy anyway so maybe that explains why I was jumpyor maybe its because this film does deliver in that aspect Its basically about a couple who lose their child in a tragic event They decide to move away and rent a cabin looking thing in the mountainsall looks peaceful and calm until they have their first visitors i think its its the sister of the main character and she brings along her husbandduring the night the husband hears noiseschecks it out and thats when things start to go really really wrongthey dont stay for another day and tell the couple they should leave asap as something isnt rightto cut a long story shorteventually they find out what has happened in that house in the past few years and decide it needs to be taken care ofIts not a Hollywood blockbuster nore does it have a huge budget but please dont let that put you off Its creepy tense and very very jumpy Just give it a try,1
Only children below the age of 12 should be allowed to see this film The rest of us should take a book MP3 player or just take a nice nap to endure the experience of this event This can be best summed up as a blownup TV movie being distributed into theaters Children will want to see this film and they will like and be amused by the movie,0
I wasnt sure when I heard about this coming out I was thinking how dumb is Disney getting I was wrong I found it to be very good I mean its not The Lion King but its cool to see another side from a certain point It was very funny Also it wasnt one of those corny disney sequels were the animation sucks it was just like The Lion King animation The only thing that eritated me was the whole movie theater thing through out the movie Not to give anything way but youll know what I am talking about I also fun that it was cool to have most of the cast from the original to return It was a very good movie over all,1
This movie is a desperate attempt to ride the skirtales of the success of the Star Wars movies The film uses recycled footage from Battle Beyond the Sars which is another Roger Corman SciFi Turd but atleast this one is better than Battle Beyond the Stars there is no real acting in this film but its a Roger Corman filmWhat did you expectagain the entire soundtrack was done on a KeyboardSynthasizer the sound effects are recycled from Battlestar Galactica there are no special effects because they were recycledrearranged space scenes from another movie the costumes look like something right out of 1981 salvation army salvage ironicaly the little boy in this film gives one helluva performance and hed resurface again to star in the Sylvester Stallone movie Over the Top I give this movie 3 stars out of 10,0
With all the dreck out there this is a gentle movie about young love Yes its true that young love often makes more out of something than it deserves but why arent people down on Romeo and Juliet Paul and Michelle are models of good behave compared to themYes they run away and set up an ideal life but this is a movie not real life Paul is more sexually interested than Michelle who has been come onto in a bad way Eventually they have sex but no one is forced into it The movie does let kids know that sex can cause babiesOne thing there is nudity in the movies The camera does not focus on it but it is thereThe ending of the movie has Paul in good chance of being found out In Paul and Michelle they separate for a time If you dont like the ending of a movie think one up yourself Alternative endings are not just for DVDs,1
you can be fooled by your first impressions as in initial reactions to a movie for example as in the first time i saw this movie i was bedazzled by the idea of it first of all i love black comedies could even despite being male myself empathise with the feisty girls fervor to see their husbands deceased without delay was tripped up by my own facevalue and i do mean facevalue response to nicolette sheridan and a couple of the other delicious dames in the picture it just goes to show you that youve gotta step back from a situation sometimes and see that its bad and not bad good either the reason im giving this movie a 4 rating is because of ms sheridan and her gams the rest of er is pretty good too but this movie has all the hallmark TV movie characteristics which means youll be disappointed if your a lover of movies made for the big screen the story contains plot holes you could run a tunnel through and ill generally overlook holes in a plot if the overall thing does it for me and i just experienced an incredible letdown the second time i saw it i dont think its a total waste of time but,0
This film has to be one of the most boring films ever made The only thing I liked is using Argentoesquire lighting in most of the scenes The music is awful and the pace is so slow that you can watch it at 2x the speed and even then it would be slow The story doesnt exist It doesnt even have any shocking scenesIt is classified on this site at least as a horror but its not Its a sort of an art film exploring the dark side of the human nature If you are into that kind of thing and can stand the slow pace then watch it but Id rather recommend you something Japanese eg Ichi the Killer I think that the only reason this film was never in theaters is a fear of audience committing collective suicide caused by the huge amount of boredom generated by this movie These 80 minutes of its length wouldve been better spent watching the paint dryI gave it 110 simply because there is no 0 in the pull down menu,0
It begins with a couple of disgusting sexcomedy gags but soon it reveals its true colors it wants to be a Death Wish clone I say wants to because the script gets so increasingly laughable by the minute that it ends up looking like an absurdist Death Wish spoof From a love scene in a room inexplicably filled with candles to heroes who dress up as commandoes and wave their machine guns because they dont want to attract attention to themselves to bad guys who drive around the city in a black van long after it has been recognized as their vehicle this film has too many ludicrous points to fit in a list The other major problem is that you cant tell most of the characters apart of course you know who Borgnine and Roundtree and even James Van Patten are but all the other roles could have been played by different actors in various scenes and you wouldnt know the difference 12,0
Its tempting to view this film as a daring avantgarde experiment I like to think that the director was trying to see if it was possible to take all the conventions of comedy film and produce something that was completely utterly entirely unfunnyThe answer to judge by From Venus is a resounding Yes This may not be the worst film Ive ever seen but my brain seems to have repressed all memory of the others This horrible flick hovers just on the borderline bad enough that the thought still causes pain but not quite so bad that my internal censors have obliterated it from my consciousnessIts difficult for me to imagine what the director and the cast thought they were doing when they made this or why they went ahead and released it once theyd made it I doubt anyone involved with it earned very much but surely between them they could have got together enough money to buy up all the prints and have them burnedThis is a movie that has nothing whatsoever to recommend it Its not even enjoyably bad Its just a nonmovie in which nothing interesting happens I gave serious thought to taking it back and demanding my money back which is not something Ive ever done beforeDont even think about renting much less buying this horrible nonmovie,0
I find it almost touching how Star Trek fans try desperately to like this film in spite of its unbelievable number of flawsTo begin with none of the familiar characters are really in character so to speak Scotty is depicted as a bumbling tinkerer instead of the competent engineer he was in the original series UhuraGods I cant even think about what they did to her character All of her dialog was painful to listen to McCoy seemed like a neurotic stepfather to Kirk instead of his trusted friend Spockwell lets just say that Leonard Nimoy was terribly wasted He was given bad dialog I do not believe you have grasped the gravity of your situation Captain Gravity get it Get it and made almost into a buffoon Kirkoh man dont get me started William Shatner is a hammy actor to begin with so to allow him to direct really is to invite disaster which is what we gotThe plot is beyond ridiculous Giving Spock a brother is a pretty desperate story line and unnecessarily soap operaish But hey lets go with it The search for God Again a weak plot basis You dont think so OK lets go with that too So assuming that the two aforementioned plot elements are sound whats wrong with the script Well for one thing it recycles way too much The Enterprise for example is yet again not working properly Are we to assume that Starfleet would send a grossly malfunctioning ship with a skeleton crew into a potentially dangerous situation just because they want James Kirk to handle the situation If thats the case then why not put him on a better ship as an adviser Adding to thatthe crew is grossly incompetent Scotty has the ship in pieces and apparently is cloddish enough to bump his head knocking himself into unconsciousness WHILE there are hostiles on board no one seem to notice the Klingon ship decloaking at a crucial moment despite the fact that the sensors are clearly showing the ship in weapons range and the crew all seem way too familiar with each other In other words there is no sense of discipline If this is the flagship of Starfleet then its a wonder that the Klingons hadnt already overthrown the FederationAs to the personal struggles with pain it was crap Lawrence Luckenbill is a competent actor but even he couldnt save this turkey In short no one could Of all the people involved I imagine Leonard Nimoy is the most embarrassed by it I hope he is anywayThank god the original cast didnt bow out on this cloddish opus,0
This BBC series is excellent I am no Paleontologist but this series gives the best historical representation of dinosaurs I have ever seen The 3D animation and animatronics are very good and make you believe you have travelled back in time The BBC deserves a pat on the back for such a fine series as well as Tim Haines who must have spent a great deal of time getting this series to air,1
Not your everyday Tom and Jerry short for many reasons One theres a voiceover narration by Jerry which is odd because Tom and Jerry rarely speak Two the two are friends which was also rare and seldom works as well as the more adversarial shorts do Third and most importantly the cartoon is rarely humorous by design and the jokes here are dry chuckles with a little cough and a bubble of blood at the end Think a Tom and Jerry cartoon directed by Tim Burton Not wholly successful but it largely does work The creepiest ending for an MGM short that I can recall Not for everyone and proof that these shorts were never intended solely with children as the target audience Well worth watching Recommended with the caveats above,1

Luchino Visconti the artist with the sword Courage should be the first word associated with his entire opus Film Theater Music Revolutions artistic cultural personal A legacy with powerful consequences and endless ramifications He introduced the neorealism through the work of an American novelist James Cain in Ossesione He gave Anna Magnani the most extraordinarily beautiful close ups of her career He gave us Alain Delon and Maria Callas But the last word about his life and work rests on the talents of a certain Adam Low and the voice of Helmut Berger What a terrible fateFor those interested there is a 61 minute documentary by director Carlo Lizzani a man who really knew Visconti titled LUCHINO VISCONTI A PORTRAIT It is out on DVD distributed by Image Entertainment,0

SPOILER ALERT PLEASE DONT READ IF YOU DONT WANT THE MOVIE SPOILEDI was originally planning on seeing this movie this past weekend but my plans ended up making me unable to have time to see it So me my friend made plans to see it after school today Boy are we glad we did The movie starts off in Italy with a planned heist with a group of guys Charlie Croker Mark Whalberg Steve Frezelli Edward Norton Lyle also known as Napster Seth Green youll get the nickname later Handsome Rob Jason Statham Left Ear Mos Deaf John Bridger Donald Sutherland plan a heist to steal 32 gold bricks This leads to the whole opening which is a good 10 to 15 minutes and involves a boat chase which opens the movie up right While driving away in their get away van Steve Frezelli turns on the group steals the gold and kills John Bridger who is pretty much the retiring leader of the group Fast foward to a year later where where Stella Bridger Charlize Theron Johns daughter is one of the top safecrackers that anyone can ask for Charlie Croker who was actually indirectly responsible for her fathers death as he called him out of retirement for the heist says that theyve found Steve who has gone into hiding and want to get back at him for what he did She at first declines but later agrees and the teamgets back together along with getting the help of Wrench Franky G a mechanic to carry out the perfect heist while creating one of the largest traffic jams in Los Angeles history This movie is a perfect mix of action with funny bits thrown in throughout Theres an onrunning joke about Seth Greens character Lyle creating Napster and how Shawn Fanning who makes a cameo stole it while he fell asleep and eventually Lyle will only answer if refered to as Napster Theres even a funny line in the movie by Seth who goes He said in an interview he called it Napster because it described his hair like it was nappy He callled it that because I was napping when he stole it The begining and ending sequences are pure genius and everything in between fits perfectly The only negative thing I can think of with the movie is that Edward Nortons acting was a bit weak He wasnt a big tough bad guy He acted like he was being paid and just doing the bareminimum which is a fact as he was forced to do this movie due to contractual obligation But even with that problem being the only real gripe with the film the movie is still very enjoyable and I definetly recommend seeing it And even if youre not interested in the actual movie go to see Seth Green shine in the comedic role Hes perfect Rating out of,1
This is a new Barbie movie The graphics were really good They made the movie seem partially realistic I used to do ballet and this movie made me want to continue it This movie was kind of like a Cinderella movie but a little bit different A father of 12 princesses gets very sick His cousin poisons him and wants the throne The girls find a secret magical land thanks to their dead mothers stories Its up to them to save their father and society With the help of their handsome prince It was a funny movie and me and my friend had fun watching it We enjoyed it a lot and also enjoyed the Indian talking parrot The music was very nice and made the movie even greater It had a great classical orchestra The voices were great and the characters were adorably sweet and cute I liked it so enjoy the movie its great for the family All in all Id watch it again,1
Shot on an impossible schedule and no budget to speak of the movie turned out a lot better than you would expect certainly much more true to the Peter ODonnell books and comic strip than the previous two films You can read the strip currently in the reprints from Titan Books or in Comics Revue monthly It is one of the greatest adventure comic strips of all time The movie isnt great but unlike most low budget films it makes the most of what its got and it holds your interest On the DVD extras the interview with Quentin Tarentino who is obviously stoned is a gas Some people have faulted Tarentino for associating his name with the film but without him it would never have been made He is a Modesty Blaise fan and picked a good writer and director All things considered worth 8 stars,1
As I am a teenager I have about one hundred years of movies to catch up on I try to see a mixture of classics mainstream arthouse and other movies The 70s is one of the most important decades for films its when the average common classical films changed into full of messages and antisocial behavior It became like nothing anyone had ever seen before What A Decade Under the Influence basically shows is how important all of the movies from around The Graduate to about Star WarsRichard LaGravenese and the late Ted Demme are the primary interviewers in this documentary which interviews such people as Dennis Hopper Francis Ford Coppola Martin Scorsese Robert Altman and Jon Voight among others about how those few years changed cinema forever Its a very professional polished documentary and its even financed by IFC films However as this is a very professional one I would think that they would at least edit out the noise of someone behind the camera laughing To me that took out a lot of how neat and clean the whole thing wasOn the other hand its a very interesting documentary about film by the people who make it Of course they arent bashing their own films or anything of the like but theyre portraying honesty on what they thought of the films and what they meant I dont know much about film but I want to be involved around it when I become an adult so I feel like to someone like me this movie is a huge asset I have seen a good number of movies that they mentioned like Chinatown and One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest but a little more insight into those movies were very informativeThe main reason however I didnt love Influence is as slickly as it was edited it seemed to take its time in the beginning and be quite relaxed therefore not having enough time to get to everything that they wanted to show They crammed in Star Wars and Jaws in the last few minutes when they were two of the most important It seemed like they tried too hard to show lots of clips and thats fine but some of them were unimportant such as an extended one from NetworkOverall though Influence is a very enthralling informative documentary that helped me at least learn more about a second golden age in American cinemaMy rating 710Rated R for language and images of sexuality violence and drug use,1
The movie starts out with some scrolling text which takes nearly five minutes It gives the basic summary of what is going on This could have easily been done with acting but instead you get a scrolling text effect Soon after you are bombarded with characters that you learn a little about keep in mind this is ALL you will learn about them The plot starts to get off the ground and then crashes through the entire movie Not only does the plot change but you might even ask yourself if your watching the same movie I have never played the video game but know people who have From my understanding whether youve played the game or not this movie does not get any better Save your money unless you like to sleep at the theaters,0
I understand there was some conflict between Leigh and the great Maggie Smith during the filming Understandable when you put one of the worlds greatest actresses of all time Smith of course with one whose performances seem to get worse with each subsequent film,0

I read that Jessie Matthews was approached and turned down costarring with Fred Astaire in Damsel in Distress Jessie Matthews in her prime never left her side of the pond to do any American musical films IF they had teamed for this film it would have been a once in a lifetime eventIts a pity because Damsel in Distress has everything else going for it Fred Astaire story and adapted to screen by author PG Wodehouse BurnsAllen for comedy and songs by the Gershwin Brothers In answer to the question posed by the Nice Work If You Can Get It there isnt much you could ask more for this filmExcept a leading lady Though Ginger Rogers made several films away from Fred Astaire Damsel in Distress is the only film Astaire made without Rogers while they were a team Young Joan Fontaine was cast in this opposite AstaireHer character has none of the bite that Ginger Rogerss parts do in these films All she basically has to do is act sweet and demure She also doesnt contribute anything musically And if I had to rate all the dancing partners of Fred Astaire Joan Fontaine would come out at the bottom The poor woman is just horrible in the Things Are Looking Up number When she costarred later on in a musical with Bing Crosby The Emperor Waltz its no accident that Fontaine is given nothing musical to doThe version I have is a colorized one and in this case I think it actually did some good The idyllic lush green English countryside of PG Wodehouse is really brought out in this VHS copy Especially in that number I mentioned before with Astaire and Fontaine which does take place in the gardenBurnsAllen on the other hand as a couple of old vaudeville troopers complement Astaire in grand style in the Stiff Upper Lip number The surreal funhouse sequence is marvelously stagedPG Wodehouses aristocracy runs the gamut with Constance Collier at her haughty best and for once Montagu Love as Fontaines father as a nice man on filmThe biggest hit out of A Damsel in Distress is A Foggy Day maybe the best known song about the British capital city since London Bridge Is Falling Down Done in the best simple elegant manner by Fred Astaire its one of those songs that will endure as long as London endures and even afterOverlooking the young and inexperienced Joan Fontaine A Damsel in Distress rates as a classic classic score classic dancing classic comedy Who could ask for anything more,1
Sometimes Hallmark can get it right like The 10th Kingdom but many of their fantasy films plod and this falls into the latter category The version I saw may have been cut a demon shown in the trailer and publicity stills didnt appear but anything that made the movie shorter can only be a blessingPOSSIBLE SPOILERS IF YOU ARE UNFAMILIAR WITH THE ORIGINAL FAIRY TALEAnyway the film updates the story to the early part of the 20th Century and makes Gerda and Kay here called Kai being a Lexx fan I kept expecting him to say The Dead do not solve puzzles 18 year olds Hans Christian Andersens basic story is followed the boy gets a shard of ice in his eye goes bad is taken off by the Snow Queen to solve a puzzle in her palace and Gerda goes to find him having various adventures on the wayAs the two main characters are older than in the original a lot of time is spent getting them together and in love Unfortunately I was never convinced that they were particularly in love and certainly not enough in love to make sense of Gerdas quest By the time the main plot kicks in the movies pace has slowed to a crawl Alas when Gerda begins her search for Kai it only manages to pick up the pace to a leisurely strollThere are a few odd additions to the story that seem to go nowhere At the start of the film the Snow Queen kills Gerdas mother but no explanation for this is given A polar bear living in the Snow Queens palace is more than he seems though this is possibly because the producers realised that the bears feelings towards the Snow Queen would be OK in a Fairy Tale but not in a modern film Again this is never explained Also hints that the Snow Queen has an erotic desire for Kai are dropped but never followed through The script is also full of anachronisms that really jar you out of the fairy tale moodThe production looks good though there is evidence of pennypinching the Snow Queens palace is the hotel where Gerda and Kai lived covered in ice The three main characters are played with varying degrees of success Kai comes across as bland as does Gerda initially but once she sets off to find Kai you warm to her Bridget Fonda looks great as the Snow Queen but seems to be in a different movie to everyone elseUltimately the film is unsatisfying It looks good but drags and lacks magic,0
I swear that zombie was killed like twice and kept coming back I gave this movie an 8 Lets face it folks this is exactly what the other reviewers are saying ie a handycam shot film Hey hey hey welcome to total indy film making The fact that Todd Sheets got over 700 zombies to appear in this movie is a tribute to his talents Yes the story has gaps yes we see the same zombies over and over again but who really cares Take it for what it is a fun and gory horror film one to share with your buds or to gross out the people you really care about LOL Mellow out people I suppose you all liked hunks of garbage like Titanic or Twister instead Peace and support independent film making,1
Fulci Does this man brings one of the goriest and weirdest movies ever made Answer yes Cat in the Brain also known as Nightmare Concert is Fulcis last masterpiece Yes it is no matter what some people will say about it There are few facts why this movie is one of the best Fulcis moviesFulci make a fun of himself and his movies with this one Lead roll in this movie is no other then Fulci himself who plays well horrorsplattergore director who thinks he is slowly going insane Its filled with black humor which unlike in the most of the modern horror movies works here Being Fulci flick you need to know its gory How much Well pretty much I always loved gore in the movies and I never get enough of it but Cat in the Brain actually stopped my thirst for gore and believe me its a hard to archive Even the Braindead didnt stop it CITB is all about gore Almost every scene revolves about Fulci who after being hypnotized by khmmm evil psychiatrists is seeing all kinds of horrors for everything that happens to him or everything he sees Some of the scenes involves him accidentally dropping the whiskey and instead of that he sees rotten corpse lying on the floor which starts to spit some ooze from its wounds Forget the Beyond or Zombie 2 this IS the goriest Fulci movie Now I like how Fulci manage to apply all those comic parts in the gorefest movie He is such a brilliant director Some funny moments and lines happens from time to time like one where Fulci says making gore movies is kind of a sickness Ending is very good considering that Fulci and most of the Italian horror masters is know for making ending with no sense or many plot holes If you are fun of the Fulci make sure you check it out If you have a weak stomach avoid this and repeat Its only a movie ps some of the gore scenes within this movie Chainsaw dismemberment full tongue torn out eyeballs torn out maggot infested corpses zombies decapitations face being putted in boiling water stabs in the shower to head throat slit many parts of the body and organs being toast aside hammer smashed face,1
I can understand why some people like this movie and why some people dont For me though I really like it even if I noticed some good bits and not so impressive bits The animation was actually excellent like Charlies dream The characters were a mixed bag the best being AnneMarie voiced by the late Judith BarsiI was physically ill when I read what happened to her Also Carface is a very convincing villainespecially voiced by the wonderful Vic TaybackI particularly loved Morons Im surrounded by Morons and along with Rasputin and Warren TRat is probably the most memorable of all the Don Bluth villains Charlie and Itchy only just lacked the same sparkle but I loved King Gator and his song Some of the film is very haunting like Annabelles You can never come come back which kind of scares me still Unfortunately there were some bits I didnt like so much The story had a tendency to become clumsy and unfocused but Disneys Black Cauldron suffered from the same problem Also there were some dark scenes that young children would find upsetting but the ending is very poignant However the biggest flaw was the rather bland songs and the way they were sung None of them in particular stick out with exception of Lets Make Music Together and Love Survives and Burt Reynolds cant sing and Dom DeLuise has done much better singing All in all a watchable movie that could have been more but is definitely memorable and I would definitely watch it again 710 Bethany Cox,1
Acting This film is a very well acted film I will say that the performances are slightly weak at times but for the most part the acting is very good The only actor that blew me away with his performance was Jude Law as Harlen Maguire He was incredible Tom Hanks seemed alittle unsure at at a few points throughout the film but he too was incredible Paul Newman good as always Cinematography This is what made the movie a masterpiece and I rarely use that word Conrad Hall is a true genius If at any point in the movie you were to pause it you will see the delicately crafted work of this man He sets up every shot so that nothing is left out When the camera is still there is a postcard like quality to the screen When the camera is moving every shot is planned to understated perfection But it doesnt stop there Conrads choice of colors and contrast between light and dark settings is a work of art The way he lights the set is some of the most amazing lighting work Ive seen His work on this movie made it what it is This movie is at the top of the list for best Cinematography with LOTR Black Hawk Down Hero CTHD Moulin Rouge and Vertigo Story People will say this movie is a 1930s gangster flick but I believe they missed the point of the movie It is a love story about a hitman who fails in trying to protect his son from the life he chose It is a brilliantly crafted story that unfolds into a beautiful bond between two people who have nothing but each other The screen Writing is worthy of an Oscar Music Thomas Newman conducts a sad but hopeful score to intensify this sad but hopeful story The music is some of the most beautiful and moving scores Ive herd Direction Sam Mendes is a new director with a feel of an experienced director The symbols he uses and the performances he gets from his actors is a rarity in todays filmmaking world I will be on the lookout for the next Sam Mendes Film 1010 one of the most moving and beautiful movies Ive ever seen,1
What would happened when a depressed cop works with a shrink on probation May be a lot of fun This movie set a benchmark in the actioncomedy genre of the Argentinean cinema Dearable characters probable story and a pace that between laughs has some thrill I recommended it for a pleasant time of entertaining Peretti and Luque join their efforts to fight against a cold and daringly foe in a time when its difficult to trust someone This movie will surprise you the other side of the coin of Analyze me but not alike with nothing to envy And if you like to know BsAS there where few scenes of downtown and the city center,1
THE IMMORTALIZER was uh interesting It certainly didnt kill me during its hour and a half duration but it didnt impress me much either A group of kids are abducted in an alley by musclehead mutants in a scene featuring cinemas least convincing head crushing sound effect and taken to a fancy house in the suburbs Here Dr Divine and his team are performing brain transplants for his rich old patients so they can have young bodies again Hey this was quietly remade with a big budget a few years later as FREEJACK Who knew that when you transplant an old persons brain into a different body that their new voice will sound exactly like their old voice With all this talk of pineal glands and the use of a glowing green serum you can almost see visions of FROM BEYOND and REANIMATOR dancing in the producers heads But the production literally doesnt have the guts to pull it off Ive never understood why when someone is making a low budget horror film that they dont pack it to the edge of the frame with gore The acting is uniformly terrible with the only good performance coming from Clarke Lindsley as the assistant Dr Price He has a nice evil laugh The only other thing of note about THE IMMORTALIZER is that it features lots of old people doing their own stunts Seriously most of the cast takes some serious bumps for old folks,0
Interesting cartoon included on the DVD of The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra I especially like the way the color was used in the background artvery artistic for Columbia whose cartoon department generally had a very low budget and the results looked like itI do wonder however how a certain um finger gesture ever got past the censors Granted the gesture in question was seen a lot less frequently in 1937 than it is today Youd think someone besides the animators would have noticed thoughespecially since its seen three times in the scene in question And based on the context I suspect that its inclusion was intentional something the animators slipped in just to see if the censors WOULD notice,1
Disneys Buena Vista Pictures presents a wonderfully told factbased sports drama directed by actor Bill Paxton Photography is superb but story sometimes lumbers along This film is about the 20 year old amateur golfer Francis OuimetShia LaBeoufand his competition in the 1913 US Open What a story a onceinalifetime chance for a supposedly incapable young man to play along side the best golfers of the time including British champions Harry VardonStephen Dillaneand Ted RayStephen Marcus A storybook ending leaves a knot in the throat The cast also includes Peter Firth Elias Koteas Marnie McPhail Robin Wilcox and possibly stealing the show is Josh Flitter who plays Eddie Lowery Ouimets caddy and best friend,1
This was an interesting adaption of William Shakespeares last known solo play but in my humble opinion a terrible one Jarman tries to change the personalities of the characters for a start He makes Miranda seem insane after being stuck on the island for so long Prospero is no different a mix of madness and selfpity on his part I could not imagine Shakespeare thinking his characters to be anything like the way Jarman portraits themCalibans appearance is maybe the only thing he got right but then again I was under the impression that Caliban was a tormented deformed monster but turns out to be an insane rambling northerner who is constantly cackling not as I would have imagined him Ferdinand makes a brief appearance naked most the time and quietIn fact to the point I stopped watching this awful adaption their had been so many lines cut from the play If anything I think Jarman was trying to rewrite Shakespeare and include his own scenes most the time So much text is cut out in the first part it makes it not a Shakespeare play but a load of 70s melodramatic preposterous rubbishAn attempt to interpret this play more realistically in the end but this play was never a realistic one and it was made nothing like the text displays it to be,0
I cant say that this film deserves anywhere near the amount of vitriol being heaped on it by some reviewers Yes its bogged down by an overlypadded running time hamfisted editing and an overreliance on cheeseball special effects And it lacks much of the energy a comedy needs to get your average audience member to sit through it without checking his or her watch On the other hand its also got some laughoutloud funny lines a talented and earnest cast and the classic underdog premise Macy Stiller and Azaria are brilliant as the core team and Garofalo and Studi do superb work adding conflict and variety to the team I cant say Reubens or Mitchell added much to the film overall though each had a few chances to shine The plot as I said above is your classic underdogmakesgood stuff No surprises there since you know theyre going to triumph What makes it worthwhile is not the absurd gaudy heroes and villains but the dialogue and interplay between the characters Underneath it all these people are children at heart who just want to do right The best scenes in the film give this film its emotional grounding Look at Azarias relationship with his longsuffering mother Macys endearing innocence in his unwillingness to accept Cap Amazings secret identity Stillers rage not unlike that one weird spazzy kid you once knew whod always go into quivering impotent rages on the playground Garofalos desire to avenge her father This childlike belief that a sense of justice and goodness will always make the world a better place is the true appeal of superhero comics and underneath its parodic exterior Mystery Men shows us why these hackneyed comicbook tropes matter to so manyIt never really gels into a satisfying whole due to the huge number of halfbaked subplots romance family life conflicts within the team etc but the main plot is such loopy fun that it makes up for that The fact that its supposed to be good nonsensical fun seems to be lost on some of the reviewers here so Ill issue a caveat if youre the type of viewer who finds his enjoyment of an Itchy and Scratchy cartoon ruined by the unexplained and illogical Am I to believe this is some sort of snort magic xylophone then you are far too literalminded and humorless for this film Go rent a Sandler film instead710,1
This is an amazing film to watch or show young people Aside from a very brief nude scene it gives an interesting glimpse into colonial rule in Africa that youll rarely find in other films It does bear a superficial similarity to OUT OF Africa but without all the romantic fluff The White French people in Cameroon are fascinating because they dont even seem to regard the natives as people The Whites are all the bosses and they expect Black servitude without question However unlike real servants you only once hear any of the Whites say thank you and no other regard is given these people Again and again its like they are pets or slaves as the feelings of the people are never even considered The central illustration of this thoughtlessness is the relationship between the mother Aime and her servant Prote Although at times they spend a lot of time together and it is only normal that they might begin to have sexual feelings towards each other the White woman never considers Prote or the existence of his feelings A good example of this thoughtlessness is when she has Prote lace up her dress and its obvious that he is very sexually frustrated by this Apart from this relationship while almost all the Whites are completely oblivious to the fact that the Africans are people a few go so far as to verbally abuse and treat them like garbageAlso interesting is the relationship between Prote and the little girl who is the one who is grown at the beginning and end of the film While they are very close at times hes more like a plaything or pet and the girl never plays with native childrenThere is one bizarre White character who seems at times to regard the Blacks better but unfortunately his character is very inconsistent and confusing One moment hes doing hard work along side the Blacks or eating with them something the other Whites would never have done and the next hes trying to beat up Prote I could only guess as to what motivated himperhaps he was just a jerk or was crazy or perhaps was a Communist agitator trying to stir up the Blacks against the Whites who knows In fact other than a few good scenes this character seems pretty much wastedWhile I really enjoyed the insight this movie gave I wish it had instead been more than just a few snippets of this world through the perspective of a child during one small period of her life The context and what happened to rid the country of colonialism is never addressed and the film left me wanting more The film appeared to begin in the early 1980s since shes wearing a Walkmanstyle headset and when the film went back in time it seems that it was set about 1960 more or less but there was never any mention of the 1950s anticolonialism violence or independence for the nation in the early 1960s I am guessing that some of this confusion might be that the makers of the film screwed up and SHOULD have made the beginning of the film earlier such as the 1970s and had the lady think back to her life there in the early 1950sbefore the country experienced political changeApart from the missing context and a confusion over time periods using the prologue and epilogue that showed her as an adult traveling the country was a good idea And I also appreciated the ending as it was a pleasant surprise when you find out more about the nice man who offers her a ride But overall it just feels like something is missingthere just isnt any sort of resolution or message other than showing that colonialism is thoughtless and cruel,1
I am not going to lie Despite looking interesting I watched The Notorious Bettie Page because I had heard and it was fairly obvious just by looking at a synopsis or anything about the film that Gretchen Mol got naked in it I have never been a fan of Mol but I cannot resist seeing an attractive woman taking off her clothes Yes that may be perverted but its a theme and ideal central to the very core of the movie and helps to make the film a lot stronger than it probably should beThe film chronicles Bettie Pages Mol life from her physical and sexually abused days as a kid in high school in the South and onto her new life in New York She wants to be an actress but she has to pay bills too After taking a few seemingly innocent shots on a local beach Page slowly becomes a modeling sensation and quickly jumps from suggestive photos to sexually provocative pinup photographsI feel the briefness of the film just over ninety minutes is both a curse and blessing for it On one hand the film never overstays its welcome You get to know Page within a few short minutes and then it gets right into her modeling career and does not look back But it curses the film as well because we never really get a chance to grasp everything that is going on She just kind of jumps around between modeling shoots and the controversies that they create before jumping right into the major senate investigation that takes up much of the final act of the film You just sit there and attempt to absorb it all and more just comes right at you It feels like the filmmakers wanted to summarize too much material in too short a film It begs for longer sequences and begs more for even longer explanations It does not feel rushed it just does not feel all thereAnother bit of a fumble although a bit more of a curiosity is the use of colour throughout the film The majority is in black and white but frequently splashes and sequences of colour do emerge But while this may have been done as a symbolic gesture early on it becomes a bit of a distraction as it continually pops up later on before cutting back to black and white It gets confusing and becomes more of a tedious interference than anything else as the film goes onWhile it may fumble a bit with the actions the film stays deadon with its themes Page who I know little to nothing about is played off innocently and her world is exactly the same Save for a few shady characters during her teenage years everyone she encounters is an innocent and everything she does has an innocence to it I never thought I would look at full frontal nudity as being something that was anything other than vulgar and depraved but here it truly is something to marvel at All at once it is beautiful and innocent Even the most sexually perverted moments in the film albeit tame compared to todays standards have an innocent and angelic feeling to them There is just something about the way Mols nude body is portrayed that it just strikes at such a different chord than nude bodies in other films It just feels so natural and so wondrous that if there were any reason to watch the film it would be to see the spectacular depictions of Mols body as she plays Bettie PageThe other reason is Mol herself As Page she exemplifies that 1950s Southern belle everyone knows or can at least imagine Despite her profession she is still a normal person and still looks at herself as being religious Mol plays her exactly to the right amount of squeakycleanliness needed to make this character feel authentically from the 1950s She plays her with such matteroffactness that you would be hardset not to think that Mol was actually Bettie Page herselfUnfortunately the supporting cast have very little moments to shine and are totally overshadowed by Mols wonderful performance None of them do anything particularly pleasing and none of them really have that same strength in their role as Mol does This is not really the fault of the actors but more of the fact that they do not have much to work with Many of them are totally recognizable such as Oscarnominee David Strathairn in a role a little too close to one of his better performances Sarah Paulson recent Golden Globe nominee for Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip and character actor Lili Taylor but you would be hard set to really place their performance in being anything other than okay None of these characters are really developed and they really just stand as character cutouts who Mol runs loops around as she picks up steam in her brilliant performanceReally this film is worthwhile for its portrayal of nudity and for Gretchen Mols excellent performance of Bettie Page Everything else is a bit too muddled and awkward than it should be Had more work been done to develop supporting characters and not just blast right through the story this film would have been a much better biographical film As it stands it is just a vehicle for Mol to really rise into the stratosphere of popularity as an actress710,1
A better film could have been made to portray the tragedy of Bosnia Some parts are very effective and the film does well to give some idea of the suffering of the people specially the children but overall it looks less like a film and more like a documentary Woody Harrelson is very good but the rest of the cast has performed well without being extra ordinary Should be watched in order to get a rough idea of what the war did to the children of Bosnia If one expects a great and gripping movie Welcome will be a disappointment,0
How this film ever got a 6 star average is beyond me The script is so banal and frankly an insult to whomevers life it is based upon The cinematography comes straight from the slick world of advertising and the talented Ridley Scott should be ashamed Demi Moore however shows none a surprise by participating in this film if one looks at her tracklist All in all a high concept style film that even Don Simpson would be ashamed of,0
I found the movie Judas Kiss excellent Carla Guginos performance was extraordinaire probably her best in her career Her facial expressions in many scenes were unbelievably true to character and they were exploited to its best by Director Gutierrez All actors and actresses were very good in their performances Emma Thompsom was as usual marvelous Her acting capabilities are way above what would be required for this character so she actually enhances it in the movieThe story although sometimes overintricate is kept entertaining and pointed towards the end Very very good A movie not to be missed A story well weaved and brilliantly directed Quality of film excellent,1
One has to wonder if at any point in the production of this film ascript existed that made any sense Was the rough cut 3 hourslong and was it trimmed into the incoherent mess that survives Why would anyone finance this mess I will say that TomWlaschiha is a good looking young man and he does what he canwith the dialogue and dramatic situations he is given Butcharacters come and go for no apparent reason continuity isnonexistent and the acting cinematography and direction are toput it politely amateurish Not One Sleeps is an unfortunatechoice of title as it will probably prove untrue should anyoneactually attempt to actually watch this film,0
This movie was so bad I dont know where to begin apparently neither did the filmmakers It starts off with a guy in his mid thirties to late forties watching TV The news tells of a corn maze thats open for Halloween He has a vision of God knows what and rushes off the save his kids who are walking into a cornfield maze and are somehow linked to this vision How you ask I dont know and as I said before neither do the filmmakers Theyre simply visions of peoples feet How did he get these visions Its never explained were just supposed to go along with it He enters the maze to find his two daughters who are lost inside and twice the girls hes looking for walk right past him one time they actually run into him What does he do Does he chase after them No He stands there like an idiot calling for them when they just ran past Do the girls stop No They run off then ask Was that Dad Then someone dressed as demon jumps on the star the Dad character he beats him up in a pathetic fight only to find out hes a worker at the haunted maze The police are called and after finding the star which is a really bad term to use they cuff him They cuff his hands in front of him so that he can find something to pick the lock with which he does First off anybody whos ever been arrested knows that cops cuff your hands behind your back and secondly why does this average guy seem to know how to pick the lock on handcuffs Well he eventually gets away from the cops who give up and leave after a the stars wife sets off the siren in the police car as a distraction By the way its now night time and all the workers running the maze have seem to have left once the sun went down Leaving a man who attacked one of their workers and two missing children in the maze Considering it was a slow night that these are their only customers why not Besides the cops apparently have better things to do as well By the way the star who goes by the name of Walker we figure out its his last name a name in which his wife even calls him by Somehow he knows there is something buried in the middle of this cornfield maze and starts digging I say somehow because I couldnt figure out why he started digging in the first place He finds a locket what does it mean Nothing to anyone who watches this but to him its some sort of clue to a crime Somebody killed their kids in his vision and I guess thats what hes going on real detective work And by now he knows theres a killer loose in the corn maze one he somehow knew was there from the start of the film which is why hes looking for his girls Every time we see the killer or rather the killers feet we hear a weird robotic sound like a scifi reject toy that changes a persons voice to sound mechanical Why do we hear this sound Is it in anyway related toanything Again who knows Certainly not the filmmakers The peak of all the bad acting and bad dialog was when Walker yells out Hey you Mr Bad ManIm gonna get you Another time his wife is attacked by the Bad Man at the entrance to the corn maze which like I mentioned before is oddly empty of any employees or policemen The Bad Man calls Walker on his cell phone to tell him that he plans on killing his wife and kids and him as well Walker can only reply with Hey HEY before dropping his phone and running off With no one on the other end to talk to the killer drops his phone too he drags the wife a few feet then leaves her alone for the rest of the film losing the first opportunity to hold true to his treats If this script wasnt written by a child Id be surprised Opps it wasnt It was written directed and produced by the same guy And not only that he also did so much of the crappy camera work as well where we get random shots of feet walking through the muddy maze and meaningless shots of the cornfield that waste 90 of the film time In the end Walker uses the cuffs to cuff the Bad Man who also seems to know how to pick locks with the same metal object that Walker had picked it with Apparently there are lots of small metal objects just laying around this cornfield But after the killer insists hes still going to kill the kids Walker kills the Bad Man and everything is right with the world again Now in reality this makes Walker a murderer hes killed a man who Supposedly murdered his own daughters and was trying to kill his He knows this not because of proof but because of his visions He never found a body nobody else knows this guy was even in the maze And the locket He gives it back to the ghosts of the two dead girls No proof So he kills a man without any tangible reason I cant imagine what the filmmakers were thinking with this one It must have been a way to cover up a misappropriation of funds for the production company I would rather watch the Blair Witch Project five times than see this film again The actors should be ashamed The directorproducerwritercameraman should also be ashamed In fact the entire production company should be ashamed If there is anyone associated with this film please reply What were you thinking,0
I have realized that many people have commented on the nature of this show being racist and homophobic but I dont feel that is what this show is aboutThe show is about parents who werent ready for kids and are now not ready for teenagers This show helps to bring humor to a very hard topic that is sometimes over looked parenthoodYes we have all had shows that had families in it for example Family Matters Step by Step Family Ties Full Housebut it always would have the same old recipe to its episodes Steph cuts from school and gets caught by her father They have a heart to heart conversation and music is played and its over with a two week grounding that after an aww Dad gets a smile and the show is over Where is the comedy in such a situation Where is the realism With The War at Home you get real situations from a real father type figure Most parents that watch this show hear some of the lines the parents put out and they either laugh cause they know theyve said it or they nod their heads cause they know theyve thought it and never had the guts to say it The War at Home has situations that bring out great comedy as a father thinking his son is gay Doesnt sound funny most think it makes the father homophobic but the comedy comes in the bumbling father trying to talk to his son to open up What parent knows the right thing to say especially in a situation as this I greatly recommend this show to anyone that I know has a sense of humor and especially to anyone who is a young parent or was young when they had kids You relate to a show like this when you are either,1
Lets make a movie about a talk show that already exists and basically have everything that happens on the show Well if that idea doesnt intrigue you which it shouldnt stay away from ringmaster I had the displeasure of seeing this in the theater and actually being able to sit through this mess of a movie I guess jerry springer doesnt play himself as it shows from the cheap props for his show yes it looks even cheaper than the real jerry springer show and he is only known as jerry in the film The plot if you can call it that is about a daughter while living with her mother decides to start sleeping with the mothers live in boyfriend So the mothers brilliant idea is to call the jerry springer show as well as getting it on with her daughters boyfriend Is it any coincidence they live in a trailer park Meanwhile somewhere else in america a woman finds her cheatin man with her friend in bed together So of course call americas therapist Jerry springer Id talk about the rest of the film but even thinking about the film now is giving me a headache Jamie Pressly who plays the daughter looks totally unattractive in the movie And remember Michael Dudikoff the kick ass karate master from the american ninja series Well take a look at him now as a white trash drunk The thing is he really looks too horrible and out of shape to call it getting in touch with his charecter But if your idea of fun is seeing Jerry Springer sing a country song about his own show or guys hooking up with transvestiteswellJUST WATCH THE SHOW INSTEAD at least steve was smart enough to stay out of this flick,0
The story of this film is truly remarkable A virus cut loose and only 1 of the human race survived The only thing we know now is that animals rule the land above and there are posters everywhere that say The Twelve Monkeys did it Thats right the human race had to hide underground from the sickness that had killed over 500 Billion people Apparently animals do not contract this disease Day by day the present scientist try to discover what type of sickness had caused this how it was created if nature did it or a mere human being had created it All they know is that there is are a bunch of animals running around a city above them the deaths began during 19961997 and twelve monkeys have something to do with it Or at least thats what the poster says So a current convict named James Cole Bruce Willis is sent as a volunteer to get some samples from above After he does his volunteer work he is asked to be sent back in time to the year 1996 to figure out what happened to the world Cole accepts and the story of the Twelve Monkeys beginThroughout the story the time machine gets the dates wrong quite a few times from 1990 to some time during the 1950s In a middle of a war Throughout the time traveling back and forth it starts to mess James up in the head and that twist the story up The whole story is very well done and I would of gave it a higher grade if it wasnt for the ending I personally didnt like the ending of the movie and I was very disappointed I just was expecting a more explaining ending then what had happen but it isnt everyone who thinks this way So I gave it a 8 but if everyone had the same opinion as me I would give it a 6 or 7For the whole acting of the film I give it a A Bruce Willis is great for this role and he acts good but Brad Pitt is completely 100 excellent His acting is so great he gets into the character so well I never really cared for Brad Pitt in till I saw him in this and Fight Club There characters or similar in this film he is just a little more insane in this film So overall I think this film is completely worth checking out For most people its a great science fiction film I just dont think it is a masterpiece,1
As a Michigander I got the Michigan jokes Very funny make fun of Pontiac Ann Arbor all those lame suburbs of Detroit Yes yes Ive heard these jokes a million times Ill give them credit for accurately depicting the lameness of Grosse Pointe It couldnt get more White Did you hear those lovely Michigan nasal accents Where the girls talk so fast you cant understand one word that comes out of their mouth nose As much as I love Michigan I hated this movie I have never met one person from Grosse Pointe that I liked Listen to that awful live band and that annoying and horrid background music What is that One of your Gross Pointe homeboys band Probably Wow what a great Detroit scene you guys have over there Funny how people from Grosse Pointe always say theyre from Detroit Theyre so White and rich they wish they had something to complain aboutAnyway this movie blows All the way from the lame jokes about girls in thongs to the terrible character development Oh wait a minute you mean the entire basis for a character is that he says the fword a lot What a deep personality Great job Grosse Pointers And I love all the sexist lingo like how the narrator calls the first girl who gets killed that we never even hear speak a naive btch Thats really lovelyAnd those homemade masks with the Marilyn Manson contact lenses are really great And I love how it made perfect sense as to why the bikers came by and killed people And how their narrating master had such a obvious role in the movie The main boyfriend dude was so boring I fell asleep looking at him The three idiot guys or was it two or four how can I tell they all look and act the same were so desperately trying to make me laugh but Beavis and Butthead already got out my butt humor laughs back in 1994 And whats with the gay jokes No wonder this movie sucked everyone involved must have some minor problems with their masculinity eh boysThe only saving grace to this film was the main girl Despite what the other people on here have said she actually was a good actress Teenage girls talk the way she talked They really act the way she acted Her acting was very natural and believable I really thought she was a Grosse Pointe convenience store employee maybe she is And yeah she had big boobs most the women here do Michigan is the fattest state in the union you know In all aspectsSo those of you who think this is a representation of Detroit its not Its the suburbs of Detroit They are very White and full of aimless teen angst Limp Bizkut ICP yes ICP is from one of our suburbs and 75 baggy khaki pants all the way Lame rich kids who are mad because they have lots of money and nothing to complain about And they make bad movies too,0

With this movie its all about style atmosphere and acting True I didnt believe all of the plot developments but it didnt matter the terrific acting the unexpected plot twists and the wonderful atmosphere sucked me right in and carried me along for the ride and I had a great time Kenneth Branagh is not only a great actor but a master of accents and he proves it once again with a flawless Georgia accent Hes surrounded by so much talent in supporting roles Robert Downey Jr Embeth Davidtz from Schindlers List and Fallen Tom Berenger Daryl Hannah and Robert Duvall that I was simply blown away I recently bought a copy of this movie and I never tire of watching it Simply one of the best thrillers of the year If youve ignored this movie and chances are you have then I suggest you check it out,1
Were living in sad times today in which it seems like every comedy movie and TV show is painfully unfunny and inflicted with cheap crude or poor humor Most people dont know what it means to really laugh at a comedy and these people desperately need to watch Throw Momma From the Train I say with little hesitation that this is one of the funniest movies Ive ever seen from beginning to end The comedy is so unpredictable and twisted just enough to make us laugh out loud many times throughout Dont be fooled by the murder plot The plot is not serious enough to make us care or worry about whats going to happen The story involves a young man Danny DeVito who wants to get rid of his annoying grouchy mother Anne Ramsey nominated for an Oscar in a role that was completely flawless in my opinion and does so by killing off Billy Crystals wife whom Crystal wanted dead for stealing his novel I dont want to spoil the jokes and gags in this film but all I can say is that you must see this film if you want to laugh Fastpaced and genuinely a real treat to comedy lovers and the type of film you just do not see today12 out of,1
Cuba GoodingJr will win the Oscar for BEST ACTOR in 2003And Ed Harris will win for BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR What a beautiful and poignant film it is but be sure to bring along a box of tissues because if this film doesnt get to you then you have ice water in your veinsIt was 1976 The setting was in South Carolina and the Civil Rights Act was about ten years old We have a white high school football coach and teacher Ed Harris Then there is a black retarded frightened but pleasant fellow Cuba Gooding whose greatest possessions including a radio are piled into a shopping cart which is also used as his bicycleEd Harris takes a keen interest in the fellow for a reason explained much later on in the film He gives Cuba the nickname Radio and what follows is an absoutely riveting engrossing poignant exploration of the human soulThe movie is nothing short of a masterpiece,1
Spoiler for anyone who is lucky enough to ever see this film so not really spoiler after all Saw this film when it was released and can still remember parts of it Its all set in a small town in the west or what is left of that town It more resembles a ghost town with few inhabitants Among them a couple where the wife is especially wicked She lets her man die in the end of the film and leaves the town but has to cross the desert We never know what happens to her next but just before she left her dying man shoots after her and deliberately does not hit her and instead the water supply She is not aware of that soon she will be very thirsty Mark Damon kills a couple of bad guys in a funny manor but thats another story which I dont remember too good The remaining impression of the film was that it was one of the first times I saw a really wicked woman on film who pretends to be anything but wicked cant be compared with the witch in Snowwhite who in comparison is easy to find out Very tight western with few main characters and still absorbing,1
The Kid was born retarded It pulls in a halfdozen directions features dialog and action lifted from much older and betterknown flops and might be funny if only the writers knew what funny isDisney stuff has gotten a lot better in the last couple of decades but dont let that fool you They should have given The Kid a wide berth sang it a lullaby then ran the train into a ravine Mercy killing,0
I knew this was headed for disaster after looking at the clock within 7 minutes of air time The story line Two people get married They move into the wifes parents home And husband doesnt get along with fatherinlawand if you havent seen this plot before you probably have not watched TV for the last 15 years or so,0
I checked this movie out when it still had 6 votes and it said like 72 or something but seriously this is a horrible movie Lets break it down The first thing you notice about this movie is that it was filmed on a handheld digital camera owned by a freshman at a community college the next thing youll notice is that the actors are all friends of said freshman he probably met them at the pub the night before Third on the list you will notice that the musical editing is horrible and they try to cram many songs into this movie at 30 second intervals also all digital editing is done on said freshmans home PC probably using windows movie maker This movie was horrible pretentious had an undeniably bad script and acting that followed suit I wouldnt recommend this movie to anyone I know but I do sentence the writer and director to watch this movie in hell for an eternity,0
Great western I hear you all say Brilliant first effort Well Im not sure what film you all watched but it must have been a different one to the one I saw Great westerns or indeed good films of any genre have characters you can believe in and this film had none The acting was poor to say the least and I couldnt care less about any of the characters making the whole film pointless the story was too big for the makers and perhaps they should try their hand at making straight to TV low budget rubbish like you see on those FACT OR FICTION programmes on scifiPlease if you are looking for a good film a great western or even just an enjoyable hour and a half please look elsewhere,0
I loved this film It was so intelligent but it also had some great action sequences without basing the movie solely around them Quinn Sutherland and Kingsley all put in fantastic performances and there are enough twists to keep anyone interested The ending was great as well,1
The name Frau of the main character is the German word for Woman I dont know if that was intentional or not but if sure got some giggles from the German audience at the Fantasy Film Festival last year when it was shownBut those were the only giggles the movie got Not that it was aiming for giggles its a horrible movie for heavens sake A horrible movie in more than one meaning Its a shame that a premise like that was wasted with horrible even unbearable moments for the viewer definetely not for the faint of Heart And it wasnt even necessary to show all the things that are shown Im not even going into a moral obligation because movies dont really have that kind of task or function discussion of what is shown here but this is a new low on the whole torture movement that has grown in the last few years,0
This movie is an obvious ripoff of Underworld USA starring Cliff Robertson You owe it to yourself to invest a couple of hours and watch the original I found this one to be disjointed and hard to follow with a lot of scenes that didnt make much sense Im not opposed to violence in movies but this whole thing seemed to be nothing more than an excuse to blow away one person after another many of whom were only marginally connected with the storyline With everyone else getting killed all through the movie I wondered why Frank didnt just blow Johnnys brains out He certainly could have and Johnny sure didnt act like someone that could be trusted Another thing that bothers me is the sex scenes why do these people have sex with their clothes on Is that supposed to turn us on Surely they didnt think they had a shot at a PG rating Nothing in this movie seemed to play out naturally as if one were watching people in real life instead it was done in a heavyhanded and shallow manner,0
Intelligent summary isnt itIf Mad Max was something of a simple straight forward nothing special but nothing wrong either kinda film they totally made up for it with its sequel The Road Warrior So in theory with a third great film it wouldve been a great trilogy now its notSuch a huge disappointment Beyond Thunderdome was Its main premise is pretty cool with an underworld think a mix between Metropolis and The Time Machine but it all isnt carried out with too much conviction Add the obnoxious Tina Turner and the no good storyline of the people waiting for a plane and this is just one huge stinkerMaybe they can brighten things up again with part 4 although that one is just probably gonna be 1 huge budgetexplosion kinda thing because this just isnt right310,0
Well This was my first IMAX experience so I was pretty blown away about that primarily although with hindsight I cant help wishing that it had been some other less monochromefilmMagnificent Desolation very much had the Programme for Schools feel the way it listed all the astronauts and this made it feel a LOT like reading National Geographic Magazine in 3D Weirdly it actually had a very two dimensional quality that only occasionally exploded into reality and a lot of time it felt like some PowerPoint Presentation There was a moment in the film when an unnoticed abyss opens seemingly at your feel that had a bit of a WOW factor but to be honest that may have had more to do with me being an IMAX virginThe commentary provided by Tom Hanks I personally found very whats a nice way to put it flagwavingly nationalistic which didnt go down too well in central London judging by remarks overheard as we leftOver all I loved the IMAX experience but dearly wish a different film had been on on that day The Moon isnt a particularly colourful subject and to be honest a lot of the 3D effects were lost in the monochrome scenery All that would have been well were it not for the documentary inserts and distractions like the interviews with American schoolchildren which spoiled it a bit,0
Well Chuck Jones is dead lets soil his characters by adding cheap explosions an American drawn anime knock off style and give them superpowers but sir dont we all ready have several shows in the works that are already like this much less dont dump all over their original creators dreams yes and those shows make us a bunch of cash and we need more but wont every man women and child who grew up with these time less characters be annoyed hay youre right set it in the future make them all descendents of the original characters and change all the names slightlybut not too much though we still need to be able to milk the success of the classicsWell thats the only reason I can think of why this even exists If you look past the horrible desecration of our beloved Looney Toons then it looks like an OK show But then there is already the teen titans which is the same bloody thing All the characters are dressed like batman they drive around in some sort of ship fighting super villains they have superpowers only difference is they sort of talk like the Looney tunes and have similar names and character traitsThis kind of thing falls into the its so ridiculous its good kind of category Think of the Super Mario brothers movie and Batman and Robin If you want to laugh for all the wrong reasons check this out If you are of the younger generation what this thing is actually intended for and can look pass the greedy executives shamelessness then run with it and enjoyIf you enjoy this cartoon I dont have a problem with you its the people who calculated this thing together that I am mad at You know how they say piracy is like stealing a car this show is like grave robbing They might as well of dug up all the people involved with the original cartoon shoved them on a display dressed them up in err pirate costumes and charged money If this show wasnt using characters ones that didnt resemble the Looney Toons in anyway whatsoever that have already made the studios millions then this would be fine But no For shame Warner brothers for shameIf I saw this thing as a 30 second gag on an episode of the Simpsons or Family Guy I would love it As it is I just cant believe this was ever made I would bet anyone that 80 of the people who work on this show hate it But whatever it doesnt really matter in 10 years this show will have been forgotten while the originals will live on forever or at least until the world endsComing 2008 Snoopy and the peanut gang are back and now they have freaking lasers and can turn invisible Can Charley Brown defeat the evil alien warlord Zapar Tune in and see,0
an very good storyline good thrill to it but the 10 last seconds destroyed the whole movie what happened extremely well made and an good story destroyed in the last seconds sorry to say but a 1 in vote thats what it it deserve i would think that Chris Shadley could come up with a better end but maybe next time all this meaningless blood gore for nothing the end would lift the story to close to a 10 but it didnt the end destroyed the whole story i think most people arent lame and when they goes a movie thy want a good end even if it is intricate but the only lame here is the end sorry,0
Worst Bob Hope comedy everand that includes some heavy competition Hope on an island with sailors dreams aloud of being in a bathtub with a geisha girl steering his ship Somebody certainly steered this Hopehackery over the cliff as it features Phyllis Diller and Gina Lollobrigida and still cant work up any laughs or excitement Wheres Bing Crosby when you really need him,0
Lets see cardboard characters like Muslim terrorists have forced a cardboard scientist to perform some exotic drug tests on some cardboard people who have been drugged and kidnapped Youll be sure to laugh when these pathetic excuses for humanoids get their just deserts Turns out the drug experiments have given them the ability to sense another worldthe world of religious fantasycomplete with cardboard demons who look like they are made of Papier Mache Everybody gets dragged off to Hell except for one poor chap who goes to Heaven where he can presumably spend Eternity with the blockheads that created this Masterpiece of the Absurd I think Id opt for Hellfire myself Go see something else unless you are stoned in which case you might actually like it Couldnt hurt,0
This was a fantastic movie about two people one a young teenage girl and the other a middle aged man who are each looking for someone to help them fulfill a certain emptiness left by former loved onesBoth actors give brilliant performances that various audiences can relate to The script although written by Gorman Bechard seems as though it was written from a womans point of view And at the same time men can relate to the male characters because of how well they were developed and described in the movieThe end of the movie has an unusual but powerful and unexpected twist that leaves you speechless I would recommend this film to anyone who has ever felt lonely or abandoned by a loved one It is clear in this film that you are not alone,1
Harrison Ford plays Sergeant Dutch Van Den Broeck of the District of Columbia Police Department He tries to get the bad guys but doesnt do a very good job When we meet up with him hes trying to catch a corrupt undercover officer Kristin Scott Thomas plays a New Hampshire Senator Kay Chandler trying to get reelected Shes running against a candidate who has plenty of money The last thing she needs is the death of her husband Shes a politician she cant be bogged down by feelingsThis story moves slowly and painfully I was looking at my watch every five minutes wondering when it would be over The story gets lost in details the director Sydney Pollack didnt need to put in We dont want to know about Dutchs police investigations They throw in some insight to politicians and the spin control they do for campaigns After seeing the movie Im still wondering why they got involved romantically Doesnt anybody mourn anymore Dont you need more than two weeks to even consider going horizontal with someone elseIt was good to see actress comedian Chicago native and Second City Alumni Bonnie Hunt Her role isnt necessarily comic relief but she was the only one I wanted to see more of Do yourself a favor wait for it on video if you want to see it at all,0
First off just to say i didnt get the edition I thought I would I chose the Italian version over the R2 but what actually arrived was a UK release from 1998 claiming to be a special edition i never knew there WAS a UK DVD release but the promised biogs were not actually on the disc just a couple of duff trailers Anyway as to the film itself just as I was recovering from Night TRain Murders my second genital mutilation thriller turns up in the same month this time in an Italian UK nubile schoolgirls are being offed and Teacher Fabio Testi unhappily married but nailing one of his students becomes the main suspect Joachim Fuchsberger is the detective on the case Sorry to say I was less than entranced It was watchable but more than equally miss ableand aside from the aforementioned gruesome nature of the crime the surprise killing of Cristina Galbo which was actually spoilt by the DVD cover telling me about it Grrrrrr and a surprise twist that cast the victims in a new light i thought this was very routine Itwont put me off the two sequels though with Karin Hannibal BrooksBaal and Camille I Spit on your grave Keaton,0
I enjoyed the film and the fact that it aimed rather high in dealing with some sophisticated material I saw the film in a preview screening and it wasnt ruined by any silly video boxes that spoiled the ending The performances were quite good especially Andrew McCarthy in a more mature roll I also enjoyed the look of the film which gave it a mysterious forboding air I also enjoyed some of the twists in the plot and dont want to give too much away in case other countries video boxes dont give it all away The script was a little over the top at times but I appreciated the fact that the filmmakers werent afraid to challenge the audiences with interesting and puzzling questisons regarding the roll of faith in our world And while some might find the ending a little too openended I appreciated the fact that the movie refused to tie everything up neatly with a bow Thats not how life works,1
Black and white satire of a Madison Avenue ad agency being taken over by blacks Theyre headed by Putney Swope Arnold Johnson who is determined to change things However he turns out to be even WORSE than his white predecessors Thats about as original as this getsIm sure this was considered daring and shocking in 1969 but it just seems silly today The jokes are either unfunny the president is a midget HOW is this funny cruel or obvious and the film is full of unlikable characters Its done in a very experimental way which makes it even harder to takeor understand The movie just gets more bizarre and surreal as it goes along The ending comes out of nowhere To make it worse with the sole exception of Johnson ALL the acting is bad Antonio Fargas a regular in these types of films is especially annoying as the Arab This gets three stars because the commercial parodies done in bright color ARE amusing and theres a rare good line here and there I heard this was a cult classic but this is more interesting than good Skip itunless youre in experimental 1960s films,0
From the start you will like Sam Elliotts character Falon a trustworthy cop that is notably loyal to his partner But too loyal and too revengeful when seeing his partner dead in an alley cause he then kills who he thought to be the assailant before giving him a chance to explain Falon is an alcoholic and that tends to sway him from being in self control though he manages to direct his attention towards finding whos really behind his partners death He carries along a rookie as his new partner which seems to be seen too often in films but Esai Morales does well in accompanying Sam Elliot though puzzling pieces begin to fit to where Morales begins a selfapproved investigation towards Falon he mainly wants to find the answers since Fallon isnt letting him in on the whole story and does not like what he finds There is not a last minute showing at who the bad detectives are which is okay and they are not able to sway Falon into joining them leading to a dramatic ending Fine acting all the way around with a touch of humor from Paul Sorvino who is the captain of detectives Its a good movie that will make you want to see it several times so it qualifies as a must see and a good addition to a movie collection Filmed in San Francisco,1
You dont have to spend much time watching this made for TV movie or series pilot or whatever it was intended to be to figure out just what lies in store The incredibly bad musical score makes its debut from the start Seriously if this isnt the worst theme Ive ever heard I certainly cant remember it While the acting talent is available here from Jeff Bridges to Carl Betz Vera Miles and Sal Mineo the writing is atrocious and the story is contrived filled with insipid stereotypes and an obvious ripoff from Ken Kesey Why must Hollywood always present tales from the sixties as if the socalled hippies were all unidimensional morons Its too bad that such an interesting era in our exceptionally conformist social experience is generally depicted by out and out garbage so that the least offensive of the genre is now accepted as reasonably authentic when almost none of it comes even close to the way things really were The best Ive seen to date is a memoir called Looking Back by a guy named Becker but who else has even heard of it No one in Hollywood thats for sure Theyre too busy pushing tripe like this groaner of a movie to bother with reality,0
Shuttle iswas more than a boring movie that had an interesting start but after half an hour it ended in the worst imaginable way I ever could imagine This movie has lost its story if you can call it a story after half an hour All the next scenes are totally out of proportion The driver is some kind of superman because he survives every attack with gun knife etc even after stabbed in his leg he was able to put her in the box But what a coincidence that there was a box in that garage I really felt sick and misled when the movie ended It could have been such a great one if the story was far more better In my opinion even a kid would make a better story And why shipping the girl with water and food I quit with counting the plot holes about halfway through And when the movie reached its almost admirably sick overthetop final twist I had completely given up better say throwup The worst thing about Shuttle is actually that it can not be even more worse that worse Maybe writerdirector Anderson will learn from this lesson and provide us with a decent thriller next time Think the better hell move to a different genre I Keep my fingers crossed But from now on I will read the comment on his future movies first before looking A waste of time,0
For a comedy this has a decent and inventive plot and Trey Parker and Matt Stones comic timing is perfect There are dozens of funny moments to this fantastic movie I especially like the multitude of colors and the way the clash in the sports arena scenes Robert Stacks Unsolved Mysteries spoof is also very amusing,1
Olivier Gruner stars as Jacques a foreign exchange college student who takes on and single handedly wipes out a Mexican street gang in this obnoxious and racist film which is so horrible that its laughable Bad acting bad plot and bad fight choreography make Angel Town a Turkey,0
Take your video camera turn out all the lights in your house and film people running around with flashlights for an hour and a half and youve got the basic idea of what this film looks like It is very irritating to watch this kind of movie To be fair there are scenes of daylight at the very beginning and very end of the movie I like scary movies and creature features but this one just didnt do a thing for me So sorry I really tried to like it There didnt seem to be much of a plot other than weve got to find a way out of here Didnt learn too much about any of the characters so it didnt matter if we lost one or two along the way This isnt the worst movie in the world Open Water holds that title for now,0
It is nice to see the likes of Oliver Stone Brian DePalma Al Pacino and even Michelle Pfiefer make one monumental piece of cinematic garbage It is nice to see people so rich and successful wasting their time on one of the most forgettable trite and pathetic pieces of filmmaking of all time This movie represents the worst of HollywoodWhat is this Is it based on a true story Well they do start with some basic news bites and facts that they read off USA today But then the movie departs to some fantasy world and a cuban refugee going to make it in the American drug subculture kind of like Rocky on cocaine Is it a movie about Cuba or Cubans For the life of me I dont believe there is a single Cuban in this movie The accents are totally fake and scene with Antonios mother looks like a poster for midwest American values The whole scene looks like something out of the Dick Van Dyke show Is this movie about Miami It looks more like LA transposed in Florida Afterall a palm tree is a palm tree Is this a romance novel The relationship between Pacino and Pfeiffer is so obvious from the getgo and there is not one shred of possibility that these two characters could ever care for each other Is this a drug movie Well no issues of obsession or addiction are even mentioned The behavior of the actors after a line of coke is nothing different than had they had a drink of water Admittedly the acting is terribleLets get to the rest The music is disgusting and sounds like latin elevator music or something out of a Lawrence Welk show I think I heard a polka The camera work is shoddy with too much movement and far more cranes than could ever be effective Clearly the photography budget was excessive The sound is bleached in a number of spots and the dialogue seems to be carried out in a warehouse The writing is appalling This is one of those movies were the script writes itself You are dragged from one trite piece of dialogue to the next each pushing the plot like a sack of bricksSo I am going to ask Is this even a movie It could be a drama series patched together for two and a half hours But at least a drama series has some kind of focus Maybe it is just a bunch of poorly acted scenes taped together Whatever it is movie or not it is a piece of crap,0
Let us assume for a moment that you havent experimented with the psychotropic mushroom and youre wondering about the so called bad experience and just how something like that might play itself out Well go ahead and pop in a fresh copy of The Beguiled See with film you have your clean trips Solaris and anything else directed by Andrei Tarkovsky whack trips ie the experiencefromwhichyouneverrecover Sweet Movie and El Topo and youre bad organic trips a category specifically reserved for a film like The Beguiled which is the sort of content those keen writers at the Times who made all the right decisions with their lives and graduated from the Harvard Department of English refer to as hallucinogenic in tone By the third act of this Don Siegel directed movie you may not exactly observe that your two leadheavy hands have become shrunken and assume all the characteristics of a burrowing insectivorous mammal nor will you exactly fall under the suspicion that your spine has achieved the same sinuous shape and knotty texture of a pomaceous fruit baring tree incalculable in age but you will feel somethingIn 1970 when this film was filmed most Americans were looking for an anodyne for their collective pain a movie like The Graduate perhaps a lot of worldendism was going on and of course you had the nightmare break down of war in Vietnam What you get with The Beguiled banal drug metaphors aside is a screenplay adapted from a novel by a guy who at least for the moment wanted to be known as Grimes Grice and direction from the director who helped bring about the work and career of Sam Peckinpah In the Beguiled Donny Siegel born in 12 Chicago Il less than 45 years after The Great Fire is showing his attempt at grappling with all that contemporary cultural madness of the early 1970s in the form of a classical film artifact The Beguiled is an incredible film and an outstanding contribution to the cinematographic arts in almost every aspect the shooting editing direction and story are all fantastic and youre not likely to see anything else like it Undoubtedly a sinister film its effects as Ive said both dizzying and adulterating frankly its hard to believe would ever Universal attached its name to this picture but you are going to see upon viewing some of the sweet sweet camera moves and cinematographer Bruce Surtees exploiting every bit of dark myth you harbor in your head about the American Plantation South conflating beauty with evil in every location shot Clint Eastwood needless to say has never been like this Old Clint he moves at instant from coy to livid his eyes like two Archimedean spirals in medium close up The rest of the cast is equally exacting and uncannyThis Beguiled will never make the AFI 100 in my lifetime but that doesnt stop me from positing that its one of the best American synch sound films ever made While most people catalogue it as a western to include the folks at The Western Channel The Beguiled is a problem because you dont really know what it is A sort of war movie A drama Psychological thriller Maybe the answer to all those emotionally wrought Noir films starring Kirk Douglas I actually call this piece a horror film because when my old man who likes to kick back with the cheap gratuitous violence projected in entertainments like The Wire saw that high angle medium long shot of Geraldine Page wrapping a tourniquet around Clints bloody leg Pa was pretty quick to suggest we watch something else like the Outback Bowl right before he absconded to another room My advice watch this one and make sure it is on a very large screen preferably run on that DPL home theater projector youre contemplating I would put The Beguiled right on order along with that important consumer purchase turn the overheads out throw some cinematic light up on the big blank wall and try not to lose your grip because just like Norman Bates We all go a little mad sometimes even the beguiled,1
This movie was horrendous It had absolutely nothing to do with Dark Harvest And the DVD was very misleading because it showed a scarecrow and a scythe neither of which appeared in this movieThe beginning was a jumble of random scenes that most of which had nothing to do with the movie except that they sort of show that the man is psychic but not too wellAfter the first 10 minutes of the movie there is an hour of just the man character looking for his daughters It gets vaguely interesting when the daughters meet two girls who died the year before But thats the extent of itAnd why might i ask was this movie rated R There were two drops of blood and 4 curse words And how on earth did it get into a video store This movie was poorly acted poorly filmed poorly written and overall horribly executed,0
I gave Airport 79 only two stars because its a truly lousy film Nobody who had anything to do with it deserves any praise except for Charos Chihuahua who does a pretty good job in his role This is not to say that the film isnt worth watching It helps if you have a buzz on but this is not essentialA79 really does seem like an early version of Airplane Every scene has a setup and a payoff and the scenes blunder after one another as if they were totally disconnected One of my favorite recurring points is that the passengers crew and airplane get to keep going no matter what Youre a news reporter and a strange guy gets murdered at your house in your presence The hitman then chases you onto your greenhouse roof No problem You can still catch that earlymorning flight to Parisno need to get the cops involved Your plane dodges one unmanned drone missile four heatseeking missiles and cannon fire from an unidentified Phantom fighter doing barrel rolls an unpowered dive and a crashnet landing without thrust reversers in the process No problem well have the mechanics check the oil and get you on your way in just a few hours Its truly funnyAnd Ill admit that theres a bit of the anarchist in me that comes out when the passengers pay no attention to the cabin attendants The highlight is when the attendant tells Jimmie Walker hell have to put away his saxophone God spare me from a flight seated in front of a saxophonist playing jazz prior to takeoff Jimmie basically says Nope Later in the flight the sax is damaged during a barrelroll and Jimmie actually shows up on the next leg of the flight with yet another sax that he wont put away This aspect of the film is just fun ONE passenger actually obeys the attendant When Charo is told she cant take her dog on the flight she leaves the plane Naturally this is because you cant get a good view of her ass and boobs while shes seated In summary a terrible movie but terrible enough to be a bit amusing Unfortunately the filmmakers and cast deserve no credit whatsoever for this as it was probably entirely unintentional,0
When I first watched Flatliners I was amazed It had all the necessary features of a good movie the cast was superb the plot was superb and in the case of thrillers there was genuine thrills throughoutKeifer Sutherland offered a marvelous performance as the male lead in the piece portraying a scientist who believes he can find the answers to life and death by killing himself and then coming back to life essentially stealing deaths secrets away Kevin Bacon offers an excellent performance as the more morally decent counterpart to Keifer while Julia Roberts offers her most convincing role William Baldwin portrays a student who excels in class and apparently intercourse And Oliver Platt in another outstanding performance portrays the voice of reason for the group and the most innocentThe story is relatively simple yet original and the acting is refreshing definitely a stand out film for the genre and one that has set the standard for measuring other thrillers for me810,1
The 60s is an occasionally entertaining film most of this entertainment is from laughing at the film It is extremely uneven and includes many annoying elements Take for instance the switch between black white and color If done right this could of been fairly effective but because it was done poorly it turned into a nuisance and only detracted from the already bad experience much of the film had an odd feel to it The acting wasnt extremely bad for a made for TV flick but then again it was downright embarrassing at other times Many of the events were not coherent and ending up being confusing How did this family somehow end up being at many of the big events during the 1960s The ending was much too sappy for my tastes because it was hollywoodized everything had to turn out right in the end I would advise you to not waste your time on The 60s and do something else with your time Im glad I watched this in class and not on my own time I think I can safely say that the best part of the movie was the inclusion of Bob Dylans music Those are just my rambling thoughts on the flick I hope you take my advice and stay away from this,0
this is just a terrible comedy it really is a bad film there are no funny elements no jokes that are funny i dont know how some people can claim this dismal short film could be smartest or quality perhaps if its the only film that a person has seen you can make that claim of the brothers but i have seen thousands of better films namely leonard part six now thats funny i dont know how the brothers is even considered eligible to be listed on the internet movie database its more like a home video than an actual filmjokes aside just skip this film a root canal is more enjoyable that this clicheridden unfunny material,0
This movie is a must see for any war movie buff One of the greatest movies of all time and loaded with great quotes such asKilgore If I say its safe to surf this beach Captain then its safe to surf this beachKilgore Smell that You smell that Lance What Kilgore Napalm son Nothing in the world smells like that Kilgore I love the smell of napalm in the morning You know one time we had a hill bombed for 12 hours When it was all over I walked up We didnt find one of em not one stinkin dink body The smell you know that gasoline smell the whole hill Smelled like victory Someday this wars gonna end,1
This isnt the worst movie Ive ever seen but I really cant recall when Ive seen a worse one I thought this would be about an aircraft accident investigation What it really was is a soap opera and a bad one at that They overplayed the conflict card to the extreme The first hour or so seems like a shouting match with some implausible scenes thrown inPossible spoilerThe 40orso minute memorial scene with requisite black umbrellas and rain to fictitious crash victims was lame and I thought it would never end Avoid this one at all costs unless you revel in conflict,0
Im sorry I had high hopes for this movie Unfortunately it was too long too thin and too weak to hold my attention When I realized the whole movie was indeed only about an older guy reliving his dream I felt cheated Surely it could have been a device to bring us into something deeper something more meaningfulSo dont buy a large drink or youll be running to the rest room My kids didnt enjoy it either Ah well,0
Terrific film with a slightly slow start give it a chance to get cooking Story builds in interest and complexity Characters and story line subvert expectation and cliche at all the right moments Superb New York City locations gritty real are a fantastic antidote to the commercial imperatives of Sex in the City in fact the entire film is an antidote to the HBOHollywood notion of New York City sex and relationships Its a rare film that treats its characters so honestly and compassionately LOVED IT Great cast with notable performances by Steve Buscemi Rosario Dawson and her love interest forgot his name,1
Terrific little film that stars Mary Astor as a gogetter who works her way up as a struggling paper company but when the owner has to sell for health reasons she comes up with a scheme for the employees to buy the company with a jerk salesman Robert Ames as the front even though she is the brainsOf course he becomes a big success and she becomes his executive secretary basically still running everything and teaching him class She loves the dope but he never catches on as he fools around with a string of bimbos She is chased by a married but separated man Ricardo Cortez who isnt free But when a society gal catches Ames everything goes to hellAstor is just wonderful as the toosmart woman who almost makes a huge mistake after she loses her man Ames is good as the jerk but what does she see in him and Cortez is good but doesnt have much to do Kitty Kelly is good as the sidekick Dolores Charles Sellon is the original owner Cather Dale Owen is the society babe and Edna Murphy is funny as DaisyWorth a look,1
Much of the commentary on this board revolves around debating the validity of some comparison to R DOGS made on the DVD cover Forget about all of that This film er home movie is utterly horrendous How can anyone with a shred of credibility claim this as being 1010 There is no plot none I couldnt believe that I spent money to rent this more on that later and that I had fooled myself into believing that this based on box cover art and some sort of film fest award blurb had potential The only thing I do really remember was that unbelievably one of the annoying main characters was supposedly offed with a bullet to the head and he ends up surviving the wound and making it to the final credits alive Wow And looky dere Killers has a sequel Double wowTrue story I actually was in so much denial that I had wasted my money and life force on this rental that I kept the videotape for what mustve been six months I kept telling myself that it never actually happened The video on top of the TV was an illusion a mental symbol of my selfloathing After someone pointed out that is was indeed real and that I needed to get a grip I decided that I couldnt just leave it there I thought How many others have I denied the suffering of sitting through the viewing of this masterpiece by hoarding Killers all to myself I had to do the right thing and return it back to the hell from which it came So as I imagine most of the populous of IMDb would do in a similar situation I mustered up some major courage and drove to the video store at 2AM After making sure that no one was around I got out of my car still running of course slipped the movie into the drop box slot and booked the hell out of there never to returnI guess I expected that some goons from Hollywood Video corporate would come looking for me the bill mustve racked up to something like 123867 by that time so I moved away from the area However coincidently much like the Killers storyline nothing ever happened,0
I still wonder why I watched this movie Admittedly before I viewed this film I knew practicly nothing about the beatles I didnt even know all their names All I knew was that they had a ton of fans they had some albums that some people claim to be the greatest ever they broke up John married Yoko Ono and John was murderedAlso VH1 isnt even my favorite music station MTV is Still for some reason or another I decided to watch it not expecting much Surprisingly I enjoyed it very much The dialogue was written and handled very well with the occasion of a slight accent mess up This is very important because John and Paul talking is pretty much the whole film allthough they are taken outside to explore more possibilities and to keep you watching Jared Harris and Adien Quinn give good performacesoverallThe ending was also very smart I enjoyed how the movie gets you excited about the SNL performace and then slaps you over the head and makes you realize that it would be better if they just let it go and end it on a good note My favorite moment is probably the touching rooftop sceneOverall I recommend this film to almost everyone It is a very good way of settling your curiosity of what could have happened if 6 years after the break up Paul just showed up on Johns doorstep Which is probably the main reason of my viewing this film settling my curiosity on who the beatles really were and what could have happened to them after the breakup,1
I picked this DVD up for 399 at rogers video in order to get enough points to get a better movie for free I never actually was planning on watching this but it started poking at my curiosity and i finally decided to pop in it the DVD player The effects in this movie are horrible and cheap Some of the dialog in this movie sounds like it was written by a swear happy 12 year old boy The acting is really cheesy in some parts and the action scenes are completely laughable Youll burst out laughing at some parts which was a positive for me because it kept me mildly entertained The plot is some girl has a curse on her which causes her to vomit snakes so some shaman has to get her to Los Angeles there are also two girls trying to smuggle drugs there and a few other people that are unimportant to the plot not that there really is a plot at allDont expect anything from this movie and dont listen to the cover there are not 100 passengers and 3000 vipers there are 10 passengers and 20 random snakesAs for the DVD there is a trailer which is almost as laughable as the film a blooper reel which is just one shot over and over of one actor trying to say train and the deleted scenes are really pointless if they werent good enough to stay in this movie they must be pretty bad There is also a really bad making of featurette which doesnt really show much at all except that the people involved with this movie were kind of idiots I cant recommend it unless you want a really bad movie that you can laugh at with friends I give it 2 kitty cats out of 5,0
Oh dear Gods this is awful Stay away just stay away If you think youve seen bad movies think again Never before has my brain hurt as much as it did after I watched this movie The acting if it is allowed to be called that is enough to cause internal bleedings inside your head The story is so thin it is just barely there no wait scratch that There is not a complete story there but once in a while there is a few thin lines that stick up from all the amount of horribleness and believe me those few lines should have been shot The best way to enjoy this movie is to drop napalm on it and watch the cozy fire from a distanceSome may call me sarcastic in this review but I am only trying to spare some of you of a serious headache However should you be what I like to call a visual masochist like myself please go right ahead and watch this monstrosity,0
I agree that this film wasted my time and my money The poster mislead me to thinking it was a different type of movie I should have known given the unprofessional look of the poster Someone should sue for false advertising,0
I have to agree with Cal37 its a great movie specially for the family Kelly Linch is beautiful the little girl is really talented and cute of course Jim Belushi has earned his strips But want I really liked was the piano song if youre a musician or not watch this movie just for that youll know which it isYoure Nobody Till Somebody Loves You Written by Russ Morgan Larry Stock and James CavanaughSo have fun watchingSee yaNelson,1
The sight of Kareena Kapoor in a twopiece bikini is about the only thing that wakes you up from your sleep while watching Tashan the megadisappointing mindnumbing new film at the cinemas this weekend Bad films are bad films and we see some every week but Tashan is not just a bad film its a terrible film Terrible because it takes its audience for granted terrible also because the filmmakers expect to get away without a plot or any common sense only because theyve got big movie stars onboardWritten and directed by Vijay Krishna Acharya Tashan is what youd describe as a road movie but one thats going in all the wrong directions Saif Ali Khan stars as Jimmy Cliff a callcentre executive whos hired to teach English to Bhaiyyaji thats Anil Kapoor playing an ambitious UP gangster desperate to go cool Jimmys got his eye on Pooja the gangsters pretty young assistant played by Kareena Kapoor who uses Jimmy to swindle her boss of 25 crore rupees Determined to recover his money and also to punish both Jimmy and Pooja Bhaiyyaji recruits his most trusted henchman to do the job So you have Akshay Kumar as Bachchan Pandey the gangsters faithful aide from Kanpur who tracks down the culprits and recovers the stolen money thats hidden across the length and breadth of the countryMuch like those bad eighties potboilers Tashan too is held together by a threadbare script centred on a vendetta plot But the treatments so overthetop so indulgent that it fails to establish any connect Instead of a coherent screenplay or a traditional threeact structure you get a handful of set pieces around which most of the scenes are loosely constructed That garish item song in the desert the bulletdodging action scene at a Rajasthani fort Kareeenas bikini moment even that ridiculous climatic action scene complete with shaolin monks a water scooter zipping through a dirty naala and believe it or not even a Dhannostyle horsedriven tonga In all fairness not all these set pieces are badly done the item song in the desert is quite neat actually but very little of it makes any sense in the larger picture because youre just going from one piece to another without any help from the script really Little do you expect in a seemingly fastpaced road movie to find a sickeningly sentimental flashback track about childhood sweetheartsYou see the problem with Tashan is nobody associated with this film knew what film they were making Whats more I dont think they cared either the film reeks of arrogance Arbitrarily packing in elements of every genre without actually bothering to stop and see if the mix does work Tashan is like an overcooked stewThere are films that kill you softly and then theres Tashan a film that kills you with excess Packaged snazzily with glossyfinish camerawork exotic locations and fancy costumes every frame of the film probably cost lakhs to put together but it still feels like a hollow piece in the end because the story doesnt hold Borrowing narrative from Tarantino and style from Stephen Chow doesnt help either because they dont blend with the films waferthin plot One may have complained a little less if the characters were more engaging but Anil Kapoors grating Hinglish dialogue makes you want to slit your wrists and Saif Ali Khan fumbles through the film foolishly unable to find his feet Kareena Kapoor meanwhile queen of overthetop delivery does a decent job But of course if Tashan is salvaged to some extent its thanks to Akshay Kumars irresistible presence and his spontaneous approach to the character You cringe when hes cupping his crotch repeatedly and you scowl when he delivers those doublemeaning dialogues but not for a moment can you take your eyes off the screen when hes up thereDespite some good music from VishalShekhar the songs seem like theyre only prolonging your misery Well thats because Tashan is a test of your patience In case you didnt know Tashan means style Im sorry to say this film has none,0
After seeing all the Jesse James Quantrill jayhawkersetc films in the fifties it is quite a thrill to see this film with a new perspective by director Ang Lee The scene of the attack of Lawrence Kansas is awesome The romantic relationship between Jewel and Toby Mcguire turns out to be one of the best parts and Jonathan RhysMeyers is outstanding as the bad guy All the time this film makes you feel the horror of war and the desperate situation of the main characters who do not know if they are going to survive the next hours Definitely worth seeing,1
I was dreading taking my nephews to this movie as I didnt think it was going to be well done The kids ages 6 and 10 were set on seeing it so I caved I must admit that it was not nearly as bad as I had thought but was still a far cry from the book The movie seemed right on with the 10 year olds understanding and sense of humor I found that the 6 year old understood what was going on and he was presenting solutions to the issues that were taking place I eventually had to explain that sometimes the movies dont show the best solutions to the problems because it is more fun to watch what happens if they make the silly or stupid choices,0
The mod squad gets started after the formation of the Mod Squad without even bothering to develop any of the characters or show us why anyone is doing what they are doingMoreover most of the events in the movie seem ancillary to the plot Without even a smack of character development the plot meanders from GenX club scenes to action scenes and back again,0
I remember first watching Sabrina when it came to TV in the UK on ITV1 when i was 1314 Im now 24 and still love it now as much as i did when i first watched it I get a little stick from some of my friends for still watching a kids show but i dont care lol Caroline Rhea as Hilda is my personal favourite character and Later on Morgan also became another of my favourite characters I remember spending so much time watching various special events honouring Sabrina on the TV station Nickeleoden UK I love Mellissa JoanHart she was great in Clarrissa Explains All but so much better in this I was gutted when they decided to finish it I hope it will soon be released on DVD here in the UK Ill be first in line lol x,1
BTK Killer Green River Killer Zodiac Killer the man keeps putting out absolute garbage and the ironic thing is he loves his crapIve never seen a Ulli Lommel film but I was so amazed on how everyone thinks his stuff is so awful Like the movies I said in the beginning dont even equal a six when added together After reading the comments I was curious to see how bad this guy really is He is the worst out thereThe credits wouldnt end as the pathetic movie started and quickly I noticed that the audio was incredibly badly dubbed in The acting was incredibly awful and same to the camera shots The editing is easily the worst This movie made no sense and I unbearably couldnt take it anymore as it wouldnt end and I was only 45 minutes in the movie I couldnt take it anymore I wasted 45 minutes of my lifeDO NOT WATCH THIS CRAP,0
Kaabee depicts the hardship of a woman in pre and during WWII raising her kids alone after her husband imprisoned for thought crime This movie was directed by Yamada Youji and as expected the atmosphere of this movie is really wonderful Although the historical correctness of some scenes most notably the beach scene is a suspectThe acting in this movie is absolutely incredible I am baffled at how they managed to gather this allstar cast for a 2008 film Yoshinaga Sayuri possibly the most decorated stillactive actress in Japan will undoubtedly win more individual awards for her performance in this film Shoufukutei Tsurube in a supporting role was really nice as well It was Asano Tadanobu though who delivered the most impressive performance perfectly portraying the wittiness of his character and the difficult situation he was inFilms with prewar setting is not my thing but thanks to wonderful directing and acting I was totally absorbed by the story Also it wasnt a farleft nonsense like Yuunagi no Machi Sakura no Kuni and examines the controversial and sensitive issue of government oppression and brainwashing that occurred in that period in Japan Excellent film highly recommended for all viewers,1
Pretentious claptrap updating Herman Melville about a young mans vaguely incestuous relationship with his aristocratic mother getting transferred to his longlost sister who has been raised by gypsies Or something like that not that anyone really cares to unravel its multilayered plot decked out with pornographic sex scenes pseudosymbolic imagery the siblings swimming in a river of blood and other bizarre touches a gypsy child repeatedly insults passersby in the street until she is anonymously beaten to death the deafening music of a rock group utilized in the demolition of old buildings Considering the source material and the presence of Catherine Deneuve who at least gets to bathe in the nude I was expecting a lot more from this one apparently theres an even longer TV version of POLA X out there,0
I am a big movie fan I like movies of all types This is arguably the worst movie Ive ever seenI get that it follows the book closely which raises the point that not everything should be made into a movie Especially since the authenticity of the experiences in the book have been called into question more than onceThese characters are not quirky they are mentally ill The things that happen are not funny they are disturbing especially considering they are supposed to be trueThis movie had the feel of The Royal Tenenbaums another movie I hated only Running With Scissors was even more dysfunctional and less funnyI will never get those hours back I wanted to wash my brain after watching,0
The finest short Ive ever seen Some commentators suggest it might have been lengthened due to the density of insight it offers Theres irony in that comment and little merit The acting is all up to Noonan and he carries his thankless character perfectly I might have preferred that the narrator be less recognizable but the gravitas lent is pitch perfect This is a short for people who read for those whose bar is set high and for those who recognize that living in a culture that celebrates stupidity and banality can forge contrary and bitter defenders of beauty A beautiful short film FWIW I was pleased at the Picasso reference since I once believed that Picasso was just another art whore with little talent like I assume most people until the day I saw some drawings he made when he was 12 Picasso was a finer draftsman and a brilliant artist at that age than many artists will ever become in a lifetime I understood immediately why he had to make the art he became known for,1
This is species already hatching into a beautiful model Mathilda May A smashing baby with an urge to kiss and killThe movie begins with a strong launch and infected by a borevirus throughout the middle to endThe weakest spot is the presentation of the basic plotstory As you should have compared it Natasha Henstridges Species got the same plot but adds up much interesting side plot and not mentioning good actions and strong clymatic endingThis explain why Patrick Stewart joins the fleet of enterprise in Star Trek Next Generation he wanted to find more models in glass cage floating inside HalleyCometA must see for a science fiction fans,0
One of the things that makes this Ealing comedy so outrageously funny is the clever editing Shots that would be considered absolutely essential to most modern comedies are deliberately left out This is what was known as British understatement Three instances A comic fight is edited like this Alec Guiness has invented a new cloth that will ruin the industry Half a dozen businessmen invite him to their office to try to get him to sign a contract relinquishing his control of the cloth so that production can be suppressed When he catches on to this Guiness stands up and turns to walk to the door Two men block his way Excuse me he says quietly taking a step forward The two men move between Guiness and the camera Cut A secretary is sitting outside at her desk There is silence until the buzzer begins signaling her frantically She takes up her notebook and opens the door to the inner office where a fullfledged noisy Donnybrook is in progress and the room is half wrecked Guiness dashes out the open doorThe following example would be unthinkable today During the research phase of his invention Guiness sets up an elaborate chemical apparatus but instead of converting the experimental liquid into the new cloth the device explodes Again and again it explodes The laboratory is cleared of all other work The blasts continue Ceilings fall down Windows are blown out The director of research is seated at his desk in a tiny office cluttered with debris a bandage on his head When the door behind him opens he jumps a foot in the air Sit down he tells his visitor theres another one due at any moment It is excruciatingly amusing and there is not a single shot of any explosions This would be unimaginable now without a fireball and maybe a building collapsing in slow motionLast example consisting of a series of quick relentless cuts put together precisely Guiness is being pursued and is cornered in the lobby of an office building by people who want him to sign the contract Faced with two men about to grapple with him Guiness backs up with a determined expression He bumps against a pedestal with an iron bust on it The bust topples backward and bumps against the wall There is a shot lasting about one second of the bust hitting the wall Another brief shot of a metal shield hung above the bust being jarred loose and falling down Quick cut to Guinesss head rising into the frame Cut to the two men staring into the camera while horrible brass banging and thudding sounds are heard off screen Cut to Guiness flat on his back Nobody today would have the cojones to NOT show Guiness being crowned by that shieldI wont go on with this Its a comedy alright but a pretty bitter one underneath all the hilarity In solving one set of problems Guiness has created dozens of others He is opposed both by management and labor neither of which is shown to much advantage And of course the economic implications have to do with more than cloth What about that car that runs on water with a pinch of something or other in it one of the workers asks Vested interests comments another worker as Thorstein Veblen nods in his grave What WOULD happen if our problems with energy were solved overnight If I owned shares of Exxon and I think I do Id shudder at the thought Where would the oil industry be if there were no more need for oil For that matter where would the police force and the FBI be if crime were to suddenly disappear This is a thoughtful and very amusing movie superbly directed and edited The roster of performers is peerless Joanne Greenwood with that husky voice The blithering Cecil Parker The wheezing mummified Ernest Thesiger A firstrate job all around,1
When you think of golf movies you think of Caddyshack but what if there are kids around Go right to this movie Disney uses is proved formula to make a movie that the adults and the kids will enjoy The acting in this movie in my opinion is quite good and the leading cast for the most part is very young This movie is also suprsingly filmed very well and unique seeing all the angles of the golf game I think this movie should be up for some academy awards for film editing or something like that because the entire flow of the film is top notch Though the ending might be a little predictable the movie does well on its own It also shows that you do not need swearing nudity or violence to make a great golf movie,1
Im not sure how the IMDb weighted average came up with such a low rating on this film It is in my opinion and by all other accounts an overlooked gem of a movie Rip Torn is fantastic as the stubborn Noel Lord and Tantoo Cardinal superlative as his housemate Torn and Cardinal are both underrated actors who are finally given a stage to work their craft onTheir relationship isnt always pleasant but its very real This is NOT the humerous and touching love story its billed as on the DVD jacket In the end it is a tragedy Lord simply aims too high and ignores all the advice to take the money offered by the power company to moveThe music is fantastic as are the period sets,1
As far as I can understand TIW WATCHER is the first work of a young director My doubt is if this is the work of a regular guy who happens to love films or if this is the work of a cinema student since there is a reference to Oporto School of Arts in the final creditsNevertheless director Ricardo Pinho demonstrates with this movie a total unawareness of some basic notions about cinema What is a movie How to tell a story It doesnt matter for the novice director One of the first things you learn in school when youre studying cinema is how to tell a story You learn that just like in novels in movies you should also construct your story in three acts the introduction the development and the conclusion You learn that your story should have a protagonist and an antagonist and that there should be a climax You learn this is valid for a 3hourepic for the regular movie for a short film and even believe it or not for a 30second commercial You also learn there can be levels of subtleness in your approach to the academic structure and that ultimately you can even deconstruct itIn rough terms TIM WATCHER introduces us its main character and then the movie ends the whole movie sounds like the introduction of the characters in Jeunets AMLIE There are no second or third acts in TIM WATCHER This is not a parody or an art film thus you cant even try to justify the disrespect for the academic structure You are expecting to be told a story and it doesnt happen Worst than that TIM WATCHER defines itself as a warning and one with no real purpose It doesnt make a point or at least not a valid one Its point is childish with a sense of vengeance The situations portrayed are utterly simple and its approach is ManichaeanI was expecting a lot more from this short The movie opens with a rather goodlooking credits sequence and you quickly realize you are watching something with better production values than the regular Portuguese short film I dont know the budget for this movie but judging for the thankslist in the end credits merit must go to the production team for such good connections in a country wheres difficult to have doors opened to young filmmakersTIM WATCHER seems to be an exercise in style color and carefully chosen plans combined with a fine score Thats all Theres nothing else Theres no plot And thats a shame because it feels like a waste of production values Hardly you can see in the regular Portuguese short such diversity of locations and so many available extras to enrich a storyAs absurd as the comparison may sound I must refer the BMW shorts as a fine example of how you can tell a good story in a very short film severely conditioned to product placement and overthetop stylish cinematography,0
Has anyone ever read or heard comments by Scorsese or David Chase Sopranos Exec Producer about Death CollectorFamily Enforcer I bought the DVD after not having seen it for a while on cable like 20 years but having seen Goodfellas and the entire Sopranos run to date In retrospect both guys must have seen Death CollectorFamily Enforcer and absorbed the flavor perhaps inspiring the tone for their masterworks both of which the polar opposite of the romanticized Godfather trilogy Being a Jersey guy it is interesting to see how the Jersey meadowlands have evolved since the mid70s It is not the swampy dumping ground it used to be although once in a while a body will turn up in a local waterway Also its a little bittersweet to seen a newly constructed World Trade Center in the across the river in the opening and closing scene Who could have imagined,1
The Grudge 2Lets see Dont get me wrong Im not a Japanese Horror Film or Horror or Grudge basher I loved the first one and the Original JuOn I feel that much more justice could have been done for this one Aubrey only existed to fill in what needed to be discovered in the ending which if youve already seen JuOn before this you already know the whole movie all it was really was a complete remake of JuOn just more closely followed than The Grudge Though everyone may have thought that its coming to America was a bit interesting it was expected as the house burning in the end of The Grudge left the 2nd hungering for a new plot Save your 650 and wait for this to come out on DVD rent it watch it then decide if you want to buy it This movie is good for a fall asleep at 2 in the morning film But overall Id say a 4 out of 10 Sorry Grudge fans its justThey just failed at this one,0
Thirty years after its initial release the third version of A Star Is Born finally comes to DVD in a package that should please the most devoted fans of Barbra Streisand That would include me since I just saw her in concert singing among other numbers the feminist anthem Woman in the Moon from this 1976 film Easy to dismiss the movies careerpolarizing story is such a sturdy pile of Hollywoodstyle clichs that variations of it exist in other films including Streisands own Funny Girl This time reset to the thencontemporary music scene the timeworn plot follows selfdestructive rock star John Norman Howard on his deepdive career descent just as he meets club singer Esther Hoffman who is awaiting her big breakTroubles dog their courtship from the outset as John Norman both names please responds to grasping fans and bloodless DJs with random acts of violence from which he inexplicably escapes prosecution To John Norman Esther represents his last shot at happiness and in turn she is drawn to the innately decent creative musician underneath the faade In the movies most pivotal scene he gives Esther her big break at a benefit concert and her career takes off Inevitably he cant handle the failure of his career in light of her meteoric success and if you are familiar with any version of this story you know the rest Directed by Frank Pierson although Streisands budding directorial talents are obviously on display the film still manages to draw me in even though I know it is shamelessly contrived and manipulative It still has a certain emotional resonance despite its numerous flawsAlthough Streisand in her prime seems like the ideal choice to play a rising singing star her screen persona is simply too strong and predefined to play Esther credibly The same can be said for her performing style since the script seems to make allowances for her softer Adult Contemporaryoriented material to be accepted within the otherwise hardened world of arena rock From the moment she pops her head up as the middle of the Oreos she cant help but come across as an established star I can forgive the lapse simply because she is an unparalleled vocal talent but what becomes less forgiving is how she makes Esther more strident than poignant when John Normans woes become overwhelming This creates an oddly discomfiting dynamic in the last part of the film when it becomes less about what caused the climactic event than Esthers response to it This is capped off by an uninterrupted eightminute closeup of her memorial performance great except when she regrettably mimics John Normans style toward the endKristofferson on the other hand gives a superb performance throughout managing a level of honesty that grounds the film and makes palpable his concurrent feelings of love pride and resentment toward Esther He makes his vodkasoaked onstage growling work within this context Otherwise what always strikes me as strange about this version is how all the supporting characters are relegated to the background as if they didnt exist unless they were interacting with the two principals The only ones who register are Paul Mazursky as John Normans levelheaded manager Brian and Gary Busey as his cynical band manager Bobbie Veteran cameraman Robert Surtees provides a nice burnish to the cinematography though a level of graininess persists in the print A big seller in its day the soundtrack is a hodgepodge of different styles from the 1970s some songs still quite good Everything Woman in the Moon Watch Closely Now some that have moved to kitsch Queen Bee Kenny Loggins I Believe in Love and of course the inescapable EvergreenThe print transfer on the 2006 DVD is clean and the sound gratefully crisp thanks to digital remastering Streisands participation is the chief lure of the extras beginning with her featurelength commentary She gives insightful information about the genesis of the film the casting and the reportedly troubled production She is also refreshingly candid about the megalomania of Jon Peters her hairdresser boyfriend who became the movies producer and her dissatisfaction with Pierson as a director I just wish she could have provided more scenespecific comments that directly relate to what is on screen She also tends to repeat the same anecdotes when the mood strikes her eg it gets tiring to hear for the third time how the person playing the chauffeur was a friend of Peters I think having a second commentator could have drawn out other nuggets from herThere is a wardrobe test reel that shows some amusing 1970s clothes especially Kristoffersons mixedfabric poncho and orange polyester shirt There are also twelve deleted scenes included with Streisands optional commentary One is a comic breadbaking scene which reminded me how much I like Streisand in farcical comedies Another is an extended scene in which she plays Evergreen on the guitar in front of an awestruck Kristofferson who then falls asleep The most interesting is an alternate take on the musical finale incorporating fast cuts which I agree with Streisand should have been used Fittingly the theatrical trailers for all three versions of A Star Is Born are also included,1
I thought the movie was extremely funny and actually very interesting It was raw and honest and felt as if I was really watching the real people not actors Its great entertainment it also painted the people as human on our level not below us It is a very good film,1
Something I think some people miss about great science fiction is that it predicts some part of the future No other theatrical movie that I can recall predicted that when the space shuttle went to study Halleys Comet that a disaster would occur Some differences were the Churchill the shuttle in the movie actually went to the comet the Challenger was only in low earth orbit The Churchill was merely burned out inside whereas the Challenger explodedhey the vampires had to get back to earth One great similarity and this is always bad luck both had mixed malefemale crewsthe legend of Halleys comet and disaster continuesOther than this there is not much more to be said about this movie that hasnt been said before As a outer spacescience fictionhorrorsex film individually it provided nothing really new but as in all great dishes it is the combination that counts And taken together this was a highly original and satisfying combinationI just wish Mathilda May would drain her victims through another part of the body,1
Thelma Ritter did steal the picture I just finished watching it again I couldnt help becoming emotional in her final scene She didnt get the Oscar Thats why you shouldnt put too much faith in Oscars Richard Widmark never had a better part and was perfect casting as a 3D flawed human being Jean Peters was great as the streetwise tough girl in her best role ever And Richard Kiley must have been very good why else would I have hated him so Yes it was heavy handed on the patriotism but without it you dont have much of a film Watch their faces The top three stars didnt really need much script I would like to have seen them do this film without dialogue If youve ever seen Ray Milland and Rita Gam in The Thief maybe you know what I mean When I was a kid in 1956 on my first trip to NYC I made my Bronx uncle drive us to the foot of South Street looking for No 66 Thats when I knew that Hollywood couldnt be trusted But I did find the riverIm not giving away much of the story because I hate it when I know what happens before I see it for myself If you have seen it no elucidation is necessary Just maybe someone who is reading these comments hasnt seen Pickup On South Street You will like it just dont go looking for 66 South Street in New York City,1

Most of the Brigitte Bardot movies Ive seen have failed to take full advantage of her captivating screen presence Unfortunately she was given few really good roles in movies of undeniable quality which was a real oversight She deserved them and was able to demonstrate her full cinematic power when they came her way As Genevieve in Love on a Pillow we had a clear exception to the trend of light fluffy vehicles for it was an interesting artistic film by any reasonable measure and in it a 28yearold BB was at her most alluring Une Parisienne is another featuring an extremely captivating Brigitte in an interesting wellcrafted comedy that explores how an ambitious ladys man can be convinced to remain faithful to an incredibly beautiful young wife There are several good performances here Her playboy husband Michel is one the prince played by Charles Boyer is another with entertaining efforts by a good supporting cast As for Brigitte Bardot the way she looks in this movie is the way I remember her as a kid in the fifties She was 23 in 1957 and way ahead of her time more beautiful than any other actress of the period including Marilyn Monroe Her curvy coquettish sexuality amply displayed in several bosombaring skintight dresses simply jumps off the screen She was more hip and cute than the women of America are today nearly fifty years later Obsessed with their careers and still desperately clinging to feminist politics they come off like a bunch of clueless lesbians In stark contrast the sex kitten was sexually liberated intelligent and clearly independent long before it was fashionable yet while fully understanding the power of her exceptional femininity she used it for a higher purpose than mere selfinterest she believed in love A still photo simply could not do her justice You had to watch her slender yet voluptuous form with its 20inch waist lightly cross a room You had to see that wild blonde mane gaze into her big brown seductive eyes and listen as her full pouting lips spoke French In a closeup at the end of this movie she winks and flirts with the camera her beautiful orbs twinkling What a babe For fans of Brigitte Bardot Une Parisienne is not to be missed,1
I have seen The Sea Within today and I loved it The actors of the movie are wonderful specially Javier Bardem of course but I thought that Beln Rueda would have a better role Lola Dueas Clara Segura and specially Mabel Rivera perform excellent interpretations And I cannot forget Celso Bugallo and Joan Dalmau brother and father of the protagonistThere are two technical aspects I loved very much Aguirresarobes photography and the score by Amenbar himself I liked the song Negra sombra Dark Shadow by Luz Casal with music of Carlos NezIn short I think that the Spanish Academy should choose The Sea Within in order to compete in the Oscar Awards I liked other Spanish productions such as Almodvars Bad Education but Amenbars film is much better than them The Sea Within deserves all the awards,1
This movie is a touching story about an adventure taken by 15yearold Darius Weems Darius has Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy a still uncurable disease that took the life of his brother at age nineteen and is the number one killer of babies in the United States Him and a few close friends travel across the country to Los Angeles with the goal of getting his wheelchair customized on MTVs Pimp My Ride one of his favorite shows The journey begins in Georgia where Darius grew up and has never left The gang head west for a trip that all its participants will never forget Darius gets to ride in a boat for the first time ride in a hot air balloon swim in the ocean and visit sights hes always wanted to see like the Grand Canyon and New Orleans The filmmakers here clearly have an emotional connection to the material They make no money from sales of the 20 dvds 17 goes toward researching the disease and 3 goes toward making more copies The film has won over 25 awards at festivals and I agree with the quote given to the film by Variety Certain to stir hearts,1
Im not going to say that this movie is horrible because I have seen worse but its not even halfway decent The plot is very confusing I couldnt really figure out what was happening and where things were going When the movie was over I was left scratching my head I watched through to the end of the credits to see if they had something after them that may clear things up but once the credits were over that was it I felt like I was jarred from one weak plot point to another throughout the whole movie with little or no transition between the two Character development is very shallow I couldnt figure out when somebody was angry or had a grudge against someone I couldnt tell if half of the characters were just supposed to be drunk stoned mentally challenged or they just had a bad actor to portray them This film seems to be based around stereotypes to its credit they are hard to avoid using when you are making a film about a singer in a rock band which SHOULD make character development easier since so many other films have already illustrated the suffering of an abused child or the trials of a heroin addict trying to come clean Stereotypes are easy to depict which would explain why so many bad films tend to overuse stereotypical characters This film on the other hand uses stereotypical characters left and right but then tries to keep them as incomprehensible as possibleAnother problem with the characters is that they seemed to be dismissed with no explanation I guess thats OK because so little time was spent developing the characters that I really didnt get a chance to know any of them so I never really missed any of themAnd last but not least was Sadies singing Its awful The music backing her up is not prize winner but it is usually drowned out by the screeches that are released from Sadies vocal cords I swear that theres one point in the movie where she sings a song for at least 10 minutes I seriously thought I was going to have to turn it off during this howlathonAs a whole this movie is confusing Characters are illdeveloped Georgias acting is wooden and stiff Sadies character is yanked from one bad situation to another with no back story or explanation The music was unbearable and I can think of no good reasons to see this film unless you have a thirst for cinematic pain,0
Nolls comfortable way of rolling out blunt comments often with expletives to describe things that he is more knowledgeable about than most is quite refreshing There is one other character in the film that constantly tries to verbalize complicated issues using more language than necessary This guy should never have been given a Thesaurus Cut to Noll and you know youre in for a treatThe way the pioneers of big wave surfing are portrayed is very evocative of a lost era Nevermind the fact that no one knows how these guys made a living much less took care of issues like medical care The use of old film clips throughout was masterfully done,1
Water shows the plight of Indian widows in the late 1930s says in the end that the problem still exists largely by giving statistics in the end refers to Gandhi several times in the movie before finally having a scene depicting him and does nothing extra ordinarily innovative or new in the movie Yes the cinematography is pretty impressive but that cannot be the soul of any movie for me India has had several problems like many other nations but it has got rid of many of these problems at large What if a movie is made on racism in America in a particular year which ends with x number of Americans still experience racism today a How would it be relevant and b How would it be some thing so extra ordinary being depicted in cinemaA view I read from a Deepa Mehta interview was that this movie is being interpreted as a voice for the marginalised every where From reviews I read every where the common thing I am hearing is how the director did a great job and was brave in bringing a problem to the world The movie is more about a specific problem a society faced and has got rid of through reforms at large I do not see any thing earth shattering about the movie Moreover the movie lacked soul and shifted between the plots of Chuiyya and Kalyani Sarala the young Sri Lankan actress portrayed the role of Chuiyya superbly and that was the only thing which impressed me about the movie sadly,0
Ill be honest with yall I was a junior in high school when this sitcom first aired on ABC I didnt think I would like it at all But with John Ritter in it i felt that it had a little potential in it plus their was something else with it I liked The acting was great not a lot of horrible 2nd rated comedy lines John Ritter always brings his A game when it comes to comedy This was a great show to watch and Ill tell you why it was a great show My father who never watches sitcoms at all he just watches movies sports and law order he actually sat down with my 3 brothers and 2 sisters my mother and myself and watched the show I think because John Ritter was in it I honestly think this show would still be running if John Ritter God rest his soul i wish he hadnt passed away,1
Synopsis Correction The ending does not show Ben cruising online for guys He is looking up Arabic Language courses at The Presido Military Acadamy in San Francisco Perhaps to Join the War in Iraq as a translator FYI many of the dishonorable discharges from Dont ask Dont tell have been Translators they are now it major short supply Ben Also spoke Russian This movie is a good time capsule of life in Manhatten but quite a bit of non reality here Mostly a good laugh at Lame social skills and the sad portrayal of Grown up twenty somethings not developing beyond the college party mode Also a brief study of the always changing scene in Manhattensomehow it Always stays close to the edge of the same BSWatch together the films Englishman in New York and the The New Twenty Both good for Nostalgia I think the movie twenty shows how far the blur between gay and straight as evolvedThese two films are GAY Time Travel For SureENJOY,0
I am dumbfounded that I actually sat and watched this I love independent films horror films and the whole zombie thing in general But when you add ningas youve crossed a line that should never be crossed I hope the people in this movie had a great time making it then at least it wasnt a total waste Youd never know by watching it though Script Are you kidding Acting I think even the trees were faking Cinematography Well there mustve been a camera there Period I dont think there was any actual planning involved in the making of this movie Such a total waste of time that I wont prolong it by commenting further,0
Its been said that Batman Begins in the first Batman movie to get it right but I think thats a horrible overstatement for I think the new Batman film although greater that Batman Forever and Batman and Robin pales compared to Tim Burtons classics with this one being the best of the five The darkness is beautiful as is the music and scenery creating a Gotham City cloaked in mystery unlike Batman Begins where Gotham City is a normallooking city The villains are terrific in this movie You literally cant take your eyes off of the penguin and cat woman I applaud Tim Burton for being original with his use of the penguin as a freak rather than an ordinary criminal or a clone of the old Batman TV show In Batman Begins we have the scarecrow whose not nearly as demanding on screen as the penguin or cat woman The film doesnt need to focus only on Batman because we already know his story and it is the villains who we are exploring and trying to figure out and they are the ones who create the plot with the penguin running for mayor and seeking revenge for his parents desertion by killing the first born sons of Gotham a task he fails Danny Devito gives the finest performance ever by a superhero villain in any film surpassing even Nicholsons joker The closing scene where the penguins drag the dead body of the penguin into the water is touching and powerful Its a tragedy that Tim Burton wasnt allowed to complete his trilogy since Warner Bros interesting in marketing appeal wanted to lighten the Batman movies up And they got their wishunfortunately Tim Burton planned on directing the third film using the Riddler as the villain with no TwoFace and Robin to mess it up and Im sure Michael Keaton wouldve signed on So this is the last great Batman Film Batman Begins is dark but boring tedious ordinary filled with lackluster villains and a playboy Bruce Wayne A decent Batman film but the best Batman film ever Never Batman Returns holds that crown,1
No movies have grabbed my attention like this one has You see I have wanted to watch this movie again for over twentyfive years The one and only time I saw it was as a teenager which may have been the year it was released 1977What I do remember of the movie is that it touched those deepheld emotions so profoundly that there is still an overwhelming desire to watch it again The intrigue this movie provides by the human element of fatherson seeking and searching is sure to touch every human soul who watches it Why this movie has not been brought out of storage and shown as often as many other movies of lesser depth I do not knowPostscript Received copy of movie and after watching it again was delighted to see that my memory held true Rating reflects movie content Would like to watch this movie on DVD as seeing this 1977 production on a used VHS tape took away from the overall quality,1
i went into watching this movie knowing it wasnt going to be great but what i witnessed was to awful for words i dont mean to be harsh its just the movie was terrible overall it had bad i mean AWFUL special effects the acting wasnt too bad but wasnt good either and sasquatch himself was like well not sasquatch in my opinion the best sasquatch movie is Harry and the Hendersons its not violent or horror but it has the best depiction of sasquatch at least its a suit and not some halfass cgi ripoff only see this movie if you are desperate or really appreciate anyone in the film or go watch boondock saints it is MUCH better,0
i like Jane Austin novels I love Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility books and movies and Im half way through Mansfield Park But i couldnt stand Emma I gave up on the book after 2 chapters and by the end of the movie i couldnt care less about Emma She didnt seem to change at all Maybe it was Paltrows acting which as excellent in Se7en or my lack of interest for the movie Dunno The costumes are nice but the dancing was clumsy compared to Pride and Prejudice dancing by Colin Firth and Jennifer EhleI gave it a 2 basically for the fact Knightly is bloody gorgeous and although it as a rather patchy performance for Ewan McGregor i liked his singing,0
I really didnt expect much from this movie but it wasnt bad actually it was quite good This movie contained a couple of the funniest bits of writing I have ever seen from a motion picture Now am not saying this is one of the funniest movies of all time but I laughed pretty hard at some parts The police ruled my fathers death a suicide They said he fell down an elevator shaft Onto some bullets Now this movie is not for everybody its mostly stupid humor like Zoolander or Dodgeball so if you hated these movies I would probably recommend you to steer clear Overall it was an enjoyable movie about a group of superhero wannabes who end up becoming real heroes in the end Its a vastly overrated comedy that many people probably havent seen yet because like me before viewing it expected it to be utter garbage After viewing this film I finally understand why this movie was able to assemble such a superstar cast which includes Ben Stiller William H Macy Hank Azaria and even that kid from Good Burger Its because Mystery Man is full of excellent comedic writing period 7 out of 10 A very big surprise,1
Honestly this may be the worst movie Ive ever seen And Ive seen Spider Baby and Not of This Earth Heck Ive even seen 200 Motels Having just discovered the Freaks and Geeks series and being surprised at the acting ability of Linda Cardellini I checked out the reviews here and decided this was worth a try That is the LAST time I will ever rely on a review at IMDb I didnt realize that MORONS were writing IMDb reviews while they were waiting for their calls to be answered on AM radio This movie is so far beyond bad that mere words cannot express the wretchedness of its vomitous state Seriously Watch this movie if you think Will Farrel is really really really funny if you think Adam Sandler is a comedic genius Watch this movie but PLEASE DONT BREED,0
So Im at home flipping channels one night and I come across this man wearing heels and makeup standing in front of a colored background on HBO Naturally I did a doubletake and decided Id watch for a little while I didnt change the channel until he was finished it was so incredibly hilarious The next time it was on I made sure to tape it so I could watch it over and over again and it has remained one of my favorite things to watch During the first couple of minutes you can tell that the audience isnt quite sure what to think but he quickly wins them over with his incredible humor and wit While many standup comedians mesh together in my brain Eddie Izzard stands out as one of the best His style is incredibly refreshing and it is nice to hear jokes about things like history and puberty when most comedians stick to current events His show stayed with me afterwards I went to Italy over the summer and all I could think about while I was there was how Italians are always on scooters going CIAO 10 out of 10 See it You wont regret it,1
I remember watching this series avidly every Saturday evening It was the highlight of the week I loved everything about it the location the costumes the actors and the wonderful music by Clannad I still have their Legend album I loved the way they solved the problem of Michael Praed leaving by creating another Robin this time the Earl of Huntingdon I believe there were legends of several Robins in medieval times Another thing I loved was the fact that it was filled with young actors Im sure Robin and his men would have young after all people didnt live that long in those days Other Robins always look too old Kevin Costner with his ridiculous accent looked like Robins granddad The only sad thing was the ending its a shame they couldnt at least have done a one off special to tie up all the loose ends and give it a happier ending,1
Like a lot of series pilots Dark Angels opener shows a mixture of great potential and a slight problem finding its own feet Not that this is unusual in any way but there is a feeling that it could have worked better if the story was tightened and focused a little more In todays world where something has to catch on instantly or face cancellation the series did itself a bit of a disservice by not coming out at least halfway focused with all guns blazingThe ninetyminute pilot really feels like two episodes glued together and both episodes have a problem with focus In the first half we are introduced to Max and filled in on what drives her We also get a few interesting routines with Max using her abilities to win bets interacting with a PI or sorting out coworkers domestic problems The problem here is that this is nothing out of the ordinary for any human being with a normal set of genes on television or otherwiseIts when we hit the second half that we get a story with a purpose and focus Throughout the two halves Max finds herself the focus of attention from a pirate journalist who feels it is mission in life to save the world by exposing one dirty dealer at a time In the second half the repercussions catch up with him and Max reluctantly cleans up the resulting mess This sets up the premise for the entire rest of the series and it works but it doesnt quite click if you get my meaning Its like most of the pieces are there but a couple that make a complete image have been left out Perhaps they get filled in with later episodes but thats beside the point The fact is that the contents of this episode could easily have been told with twentyeight less minutesThe last of the negatives is that a lot of the support cast are totally unendearing Original Cindy in particular is an annoyance and I doubt that changed during the next twenty episodes While the acting isnt as bad as daytime soap it isnt of such quality that Id commend it Jessica Alba is not the worst actor in the world but she does come up short in terms of being convincing when the story needs it leastThe good news is that the premise and the production values are all topnotch In fact this series was considered quite expensive to produce and it is quite unfortunate that it was cancelled in order to be replaced by another show that didnt last a whole season Especially when there was ample time for both shows they could have simply cancelled one of the pieces of disingenious garbage they flog under the banner of reality TV The fact is that we need more shows like Dark Angel where imagination rather than overhype are used to draw the attentionIn all I gave the Dark Angel pilot a seven out of ten It never rises above the level of throwaway television and it never got a chance to live up to the potential it shows within its own running time But the potential is there and thats often all that matters where pilots are concerned,1
This movie features some of the best ensemble work Ive seen in film or on stage The actors play off each other with a skill and vivacity that in no way can be achieved through editingLove Jones a good story period But it is also an excellent portrayal of the urban middleincome twentysomething AfricanAmerican set that is not often seen,1
I noticed Fire was on cable the other night and I began watching it because I couldnt recall anything specific about it other than I remember it being a horrible film when I saw it back in 85 Twenty years later the film is still awful Besides the synthesizer the saxophone was the most abused instrument in pop music during the 1980s as is evident in the title song Hearing that song again made me want to jab a screwdriver in my ears to end the sonic misery inflicted upon them And to compound this musical assault Rob Lowes character played saxophone and there was one scene where he played a solo that went on and on like he was Charlie Parker only his shrill tone and playing were more reminiscent of a monkey playing a kazoo All the characters were intensely unappealing although I must say they did a great job of casting equally unappealing actors to portray them Actually I thought Mare Winningham was appealing and I initially felt sorry for her character because she wore funny underwear but then near the end of the movie she decides to have sex with Rob Lowes character who would probably be voted most likely to transfer a variety of sexual diseases if such thing were voted upon,0
This movie i totally not funny and I would imagine to be pretty offensive to Jewish people and I am not Jewish Why First the whole movie portray the protagonist Zucker as a liercheat running shady business and deals while his son is gay his daughter is lesbian and his niece is a slut Then there is the incestuous relationship that happens in the family first his daughter with his Joshua and Jana and then his son with his niece Two incestuous relationship running in family I am surprised they didnt add the plot of having a mentally disabled in the familyNow that would really complete the Nazi ideal subhuman gay lesbian JewTotally disgusting film I am surprised this film gets no response from any Jewish community,0
They did it again ripped off an old shows title then destroyed the nostalgia with boring reimagined stuff The 60s cartoon was one of the funniest of its time a goodnatured satire of super hero comic books The character was drawn as 12 way between animal and human the way Mickey Mouse is Here they use a real beagle thats about the same as making a Mickey Mouse watch with a real rat Most of the clever schtick that made the original show funny is missing from this film Instead we get a clumsy expolice dog whos even dumber than Cad And some pet owners who add nothing to the story Cheesy effects the dogtalking animation is embarrassing Poor scripting A stereotyped dwarf playing Simon Bar Sinister The gravelly noise box guy they hired to voice Underdog is painful Youd think theyd at least gotten a voice impressionist to approximate Wally Coxs humorously distinctive voice for Underdog But no There are at least a few affectionate references to the source material such as the rhyming lines which lift it to a 4 Only small children that love dogs may enjoy this Everybody else should get a DVD of the original cartoon series Watch this only in desperation,0
This film is not only the last piece of the Three Colours trilogy but also the best of the three and one of the best movies of the 90s Theres hardly another movie that so wisely and consequently asks for humanity and respect for every human being Valentine Irene Jacob lives in Geneva where she works as a model Though she has a boyfriend she seems to be rather lonely One night she has an accident and injures a dog and who leads her to his owner a retired jugde JeanLouis Trintignant who is cynical and spies his neighbors phone calls Disgusted by him she cannot go away and they meet again Two lonely souls meet each other and they become friends and develop a deep love for each other The story itself is too complex to be told completely there is another connection between them in a young man who represents both the judge and Valentines real love and there is more to their relationship than only friendshipThe actors are wonderful Irene Jacob and JeanLouis Trintignant developing a deep and authentic friendship The topics are of an endless validity Fraternity not only in contact with each other but also in the respect for the right of privacy Alarmingly we seem to loose this right more and more which makes movies like this one even more important than it might have been in 1994Red is one of the strongest colours that exists representing inner turmoil love anger and passion Used here as another protagonist it brings a unmatched depth to the movie A masterpiece,1
I really loved the Millenium series starred by Lance Henriksen which is why I bought the film Obviously at some level it was a mistake Mutantmonster films are usually very bad and this film is no exceptionThe basic idea itself is not totally judged to fail well nevertheless this film would never have been a success even with a good director actors but the way it turns out this is just a Bclass movie The scenes that are supposed to be scary seem more funny to me and the critter is not credible at allHowever watching this film with group of friends in restless mood makes this film shine as it is so unintentionally hilarious,0
So I flipped on the digital subscriber channels one night a couple of years ago and thought Id pass a half hour watching Girlfight while waiting for Harts War to start With a title like that I figured it was some exploitation B flic about inner city girl gangsMuch to my surprise it wasnt about that at all Instead it is a well acted well scripted story about a young woman who almost accidentally gets into female boxing She is responsible for taking her younger brother to his practice sessions and get interested while observing his bouts As he doesnt really want to be a boxer only following through on their fathers wishes she convinces his coach to take her on in his stead The story unfolds in an intelligent and believable way as she goes through various trials on her quest For starters her brothers coach doesnt want to take on a female boxer After grudgingly doing so there is the problem of lining up matches for her Then the confrontation with her father when he finds out what is going on Yes a love interest develops but it serves to enhance the plot coming across more of an interesting interhuman reaction with its own fight related consequencesAll in all this is a great little sleeper movie that few seem to have heard of Some time later when I saw the much advertised and acclaimed Million Dollar Baby I thought wait a minute this seems kind of familiar Needless to say I didnt watch Harts War that night,1
Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon both of whom are sadly missed proved once again that they were a team dedicated to their craft of bringing hilarious moments to the screen This film is just another example of thisThis time out they play two brothersinlaw who land on a ship as dance instructors on boardOf course their boss is a perfectionist and miserable person named Gil Godwin who just enjoys harassing these boys Its hilarious how Lemmon gives a quick lesson in dancing to Matthau and how the latter dances a riotous rumba with the boats owner Rue McLanahanToo bad that fellow dance instructors Hal Linden and Donald OConnor are given so little to do but their parts call for that Matthau falls for Dyan Cannon on board with her fellow golddigging mother the usual outrageous Elaine Stritch Unknown to them Matthau has no money either The widower Lemmon falls for Gloria De Haven looking lovelier than everThe film belongs to Matthau and Lemmon and will serve as a further tribute to their illustrious careers,1
I am proud of Head Mike Nesmith has said He should be because this film which either has been derided by many of us or studied and scrutinized by film professors works on many levelsYes its unconventional To many frustrating Its almost as if the producers hand you the film and tempt You figure it outYou probably already know that The Monkees TV show was a runaway marketing success that depended upon business acumen and no small serving of public deception TV shows are about selling soap and toothpaste first than to entertain That The Monkees broke out of the box for a short time to make Head is a testament to the groups popularity and importance in pop culture despite where your heads at Get one thing straight Head is not The Monkees TV showSo what we have here is a psychedelic documentary about Western pop culture from a source that has authority on the subject Head is a movie that could only come from those inside the box By 1968 The Monkees cast and crew were seasoned and weary professionals who had seen their share of promise and disappointment The movie was a deliberate attempt at market repositioning So it did three things Make a film the way The Monkees envisioned Most importantly reinvent the group to one not subservient to its old bosses and yas hipper than before Make a film that exposed American attitudes of information disseminationHead therefore really is about media manipulation and its net result deception The mass media is supposed to inform educate us on the happenings in the world at large and ultimately asks us to form opinions of these events that can shape thought into positive action Thus we assume the information we absorb to be complete and unbiased otherwise how can one establish a valued conclusion on any one idea presented by a book newspaper or TV show In one of the street interviews in Head a guy admits I havent looked at a newspaper or TV in years Is he lesser or better the man Even the drug parallels are a soft veiling of Things are not as they seem Remember the old joke Everything you know is wrong The screenplay starts with The Monkees public admission of its own manufactured image and runs with the football literally Is the football scene in the movie a visual manifestation of the whole idea behind Head Is the film a streamofconsciousness exercise Is the film the culmination of pot smoking marathons There are too many coincidences that occur in the film that suggest otherwise My guess is that Head is the culmination of motivations somewhere between intended and unintendedLargely the insiders responsible for Head seem to enjoy themselves in the revelries that take place in the film but there is anger anger at the chaos that characterized the late 60s and anger at the way the media television especially had changed culture in negative ways Drugs and violence were strong negative forces in the late 60s and still are but the producers of Head want you to know that poor information is a far greater dangerWars have been attributed to hoaxes and lies What perfect way to spread disinformation than through TV Repeatedly the mysterious black box is seen as an obstacle to The Monkees and seemingly all of us as well In one scene Peter is sullenly sitting in a saloon holding a melting ice cream cone and is asked by a fellow Monkey Whats wrong I bought this ice cream cone and I dont want it The movie suggests that the first purpose of the media is NOT to inform but to sell en mass blindly Head goes further put any idea into someones head and merrily goes heThe filmmakers know this and the danger is real Head is either a movie that creates itself as we go along or is a deliberate statement Perhaps perhaps not Maybe it is just Pot meets advertising as critics scathed in 1968 The jokes are on The Monkees and us Be careful what you ask for you may get itCheers A true guilty pleasure Very funny Intelligent Will please the fans Find the substance its there Unabashedly weird Bizarre collection of characters Good tunage Length is appropriate Lots of great one liners including my all time prophetic favorite The tragedy of your times my young friends is that you may get exactly what you wantCaveats Dated Drugs No plot No linear delivery of any thought in particular At least twentyfive stories that interweave in stopand go fashion So may easily frustrate May seem pretentious to some People who cant stand The Monkees need not watch though that in itself is no reason to avoid it The psychedelic special effects may kill your ailing picture tube or your acid burnt out eyeballsMatch cut,1
Stanley Kubrick a director who I hold in the highest of esteems for his masterpieces Clockwork Orange 2001 The Killing the Shining Dr Strangelove etc took the film out of circulation leaving it to be found by only the hardcore fans and completists After seeing the film for myself I could see why At the age of 24 Kubrick had already honed his craft of still photography for LOOK magazine and had done a few short documentaries Like many firsttime filmmakers that came in the decades after him his ambition for Fear and Desire was in short to just go and make a film cheaply more than likely to see if he could do it On that level he was successful However the film itself definitely is notI cant really say that the film is a failure because there was something I did like about it throughout Even as the films story went on the wayside and the actors whom Kubrick didnt have any idea how to direct not being a man of the theater his knack for producing and capturing some great images gets its seeds in this film At times there are some shots of closeups and quickshots in suspenseaction scenes that are eyecatching Unfortunately this is all the good I can really say of the film Although there are a couple of name actors in the film Frank Slivera who also appeared in Killers Kiss and Paul Mazursky a director in his own right the performances overall are dull and very routineIn fact that is the films main demise for me whenever I watch any Kubrick film even his early film noirs Killers Kiss and the Killing I can tell who made it as his style by then became distinct which would continue as he evolved as an artist It wasnt artsy like I might have pictured which is usually the case with firsttime directors like Scorsese and Spielberg but watching this film not only did it feel like it wasnt Kubrick it felt like a lot of the time I was watching some B or even C grade movie by a director that time forgot not quite Ed Wood bad but close The music is as standard as can be the fades are pedestrian and the plot seems to not really hold that much attentionIn short as others have said and which I can agree this is a doodle pad of a future groundbreaker who shows some shots and a few edits that grab some attention the best scene overall being when the soldiers take the dumb girl hostage but not enough to really recommend except to those like myself who end up seeing everything by Kubrick or perhaps have to see every ultralow budget war film ever made if only out of curiosity,0
Three young movie theater employees are given the task of reopening a long closed oldtime theater at which many years before a shocking series of grisly murders took place It seems many more murders have occurred since then but all of this remains unknown to these three young upstart employees hoping to finally make it big on their own As they approach the grand reopening night things keep getting stranger and more unsettling with items suddenly starting to move around by themselves without any seen aid and a terrifying old man seemingly haunting the premisesOh this is truly horrible In fact if it wasnt for Mary Woronovs secretary character being such a fiercely independent outspoken empowered young woman who steals practically every scene in which she appears and the incredibly hot chick who played the unbelievably sleazy yet totally sexy Selina this would be a total loss The only other good thing I have to say about this film is some of the movie theater murders are done in truly inventive albeit not overly gory a preference for me but not necessarily for others fashion The rest just wallows in constant sleaze so extreme the rare few may actually find humor in it and runs through the predictable slasher kills annoying characters off one after the other routine,0
Personally I couldnt get into This is Not a Love Song its a brilliant film and theres a great story line to it I just found myself checking the time on my phone every two minuets to see how much was left of the filmI love the relationship between Spike and Heaton there that close they depend on each other to get along in life At the same time I wish the relationship was more than what it is Heaton is in love with spike but Spike Ibsent in love with Heaton or he doesnt know how to love him The acts of betrayal on both parts have a big effect on the two men They are both devastated by the fact that the other ran away and abandoned them at a time when they truly needed each other for survival,1
WARNING MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS WHICH WILL BE MORE ENTERTAINING THAN THIS TRIPE Heres some good advise to anyone living in the UK Whenever Channel 5 has an old 80s comedy on late at night read a book instead I am currently in the process of recovering from a seizure due to reading some of the comments on this film on here I am actually shocked at the fact that someone actually said this film was realistic All I can say is thank god the Cold War never escalated or else we might as well have given the Commies our borders I found this film dire in the utmost pretence maybe it is just my British perception of what makes a film funny who knows But in all aspects this film is not just awful its teeth grindingly terribleIve never been a fan of Bill Murray and its rubbish like this that justify my feelings towards him Dont get me wrong I loved Ghostbusters which was made only three years after this film But this just sums Bill Murray up really I can safely say that I havent wasted my time so blatantly like this since seeing the first running of Operation Delta Force over here though these two films have more in common than you would think For 1 thing they both have terrible action sequences from beginning to end and 2nd They are both riddled with cheesy Clichs throughoutHeres one thing these guys are supposed to be in the US Army Yet they are allowed to wallow around their Camp Willy nilly seducing female Military Police Officers and subsequently shagging them silly in the Generals Quarters Talk about Random This film is just terrible for this Im afraid Now dont get me wrong Im no feminist sympathiser but the fact that these two women actually fall hands over heels in love with the two characters shortly after arresting them letting them go free Twice is just insulting to the female race The fact that one tatty haired fat lipped bum Winger and his hapless sidekick Ramis can simply sweet talk themselves into into the MPs underwear to which they fall madly in love with the two of them is nothing short of ludicrousThen there is the training scenes where you get to meet the Squad Phycho who unconvincingly threatens to kill anyone who touches him or his stuff followed by the overweight bloke played by the late and great John Candy who claims he joined the army to avoid paying 400 for anger management classes Leading to loud mouthed Murray paying tribute to the Giant Toe WTF Drill Seargent who honestly couldnt organise a pi up in a brewery let alone his band of recruits All this scene serves to do is to prelude loads of fight scenes with people saying way to go ass hole all the time etc etcThe scenes then carry on showing the rag tag bunch making utter tits of themselves on the Assault Course leading to a scene where one of them shoots wildly into the air at some passing birds with an assault rifle peppering a watch tower with bullets Just like that Yep told you this film was randomHe miraculously escapes undisciplined as well Eventually Leading up the the passing out parade where the hapless squad make a magic turn around within the space of two hours Bugger me Miracle Thanks to some wise words from Murray to which they then direct a massively none military like dance routine in front of a Geriatric General in front of the rest of the squads All of this to the immense pleasure of their two Girlfriends on the stand who really shouldve been arresting them Everyone laughs it off though This bit is nothing short of amazing though He then chooses them to guard a new MultiMillion Dollar Prototype Armoured Vehicle in Italy which turns out to be just a mobile home painted green with loads of gadgets on the inside claiming This is exactly what this Army needs rightoThen there is the dire finale where Murray and Ramis decide to steal this topsecret prototype Military Vehicle to pick up their newly acquired and somewhat Hyperactive MP Girlfriends in Germany To which the Hapless Captain John Larroquette then finds out and leads the Squad of fresh recruits on a retrieval Mission for this vehicle To which they then take a wrong turn enroute and end up in Soviet Held Czechoslovakia where they are captured Like we didnt see that coming Thus begins a rescue attempt by Ramis and Murray Birds in hand to which is where a big fight loads of shooting from the hip and blowing tanks up With them coming back as National Heroes humiliating the Russians by calling them pussies etc etc The end Thats right No Courts Martial nothing They only just stole a prototype Military vehicle drove it into a Warsaw Pact country and almost caused an International incident which couldve sparked WW3This film is honestly more fun that being diagnosed with a terminal illness I know its meant to be a Comedy it got all the right actors for it but where in the hell is it Have Channel 5 cuts those bits out The only redeeming feature in this film is the repetitive use of naked women taking showers and female Mud Wrestling like I said Random Not that it helps to divert from the fact that this is an utterly crap film of course This film should realistically be aimed at immature 9 year olds sadly we have to watch it instead 1 star out of 10 Total Tripe My advice do something a little more useful with your time Like Castrating yourself,0
It beats me how anyone can rate this film very highly It is no understatement to call it far fetched How the guy managed in such a short space of time to construct a wooden maze of underground rooms is quite ridiculous or maybe he was the greatest carpenter since Jesus The obese sheriff played by Hoyt Axton looked like a refugee from the Jerry Springer show and I found the blonde female lead Jennifer Jason Leigh rather plain We have an expression here in the UK mutton done up as lamb which suits her perfectly It wasnt all bad however I enjoyed it immensely when the end credits rolled and The End came up was quite brilliant for this hotch potch of a TV movie which if it had been a cinematic release would have been put on video and in discount stores in no time at all,0
Apart from having the longest reign in British history 63 years Queen Victoria also holds two other distinctions She was apart from our current Queen the oldest ever British monarch living to the age of 81 And she was also the youngest ever British as opposed to English or Scottish monarch coming to the throne as a girl of eighteen And yet whenever television or the cinema make a programme or film about her they seem far more interested in the older Victoria than they do in the young girl the version of Victoria with which modern audiences will probably be most familiar is Judi Dench in Mrs Brown The Young Victoria tries to redress the balance by showing us the events surrounding her accession and the early years of her reign It has the rare distinction of being produced by a former Royal Sarah Duchess of York whose daughter Princess Beatrice makes a brief appearance as an extraThere are three main strands to the plot The first concerns the intrigues of Victorias mother the Duchess of Kent a highly unpopular figure even with her own daughter largely because of the influence of her adviser Sir John Conroy who was widely rumoured to be her lover According to one unfounded rumour he and not the late Duke of Kent was Victorias natural father The second strand concerns the growing romance between Victoria and her German cousin Prince Albert and the attempts of King Leopold of Belgium who was uncle to both of them to influence this romance Leopolds hope was to increase the prestige of the House of SaxeCoburg to which both he and Albert belonged The third concerns one of the strangest episodes in British political history the Bedchamber Crisis of 1839 when supporters of the Tory Party which had traditionally supported a strong monarchy rioted because the young Queen was perceived to favour the Whig Party and their leader Lord Melbourne even though the Whigs had historically supported a quasirepublican system of government with the monarch reduced to a figureheadScriptwriter Julian Fellowes is known for his Conservative views and at times I wondered if this may have coloured his treatment of political themes as he seems to lean to the side of the Tories the predecessors of the modern Conservative party Their leader Robert Peel is shown as statesmanlike and dignified whereas Melbourne for all his dash and charm is shown as devious and uninterested in social reform There may be some truth is these characterisations but Fellowes glosses over the fact that only a few years earlier the Tories had opposed the Reform Act which ended the corrupt electoral system of rotten boroughs and that they had benefited from William IVs unconstitutional dismissal of a Whig administrationLessons in dynastic and constitutional history do not always transfer well to the cinema screen and this one contains its share of inaccuracies Prince Albert for example was not injured in Edward Oxfords attempt on Victorias life and Melbourne in his late fifties at the time of Victorias accession was not as youthful as he is portrayed here by Paul Bettany King William IV certainly disliked the Duchess of Kent who was his sisterinlaw but I doubt if he would have gone so far as to bawl abuse at her during a state banquet as he is shown doing here I also failed to understand the significance of the scene in which the Duchess and Conroy try to force Victoria to sign a Regency Order the Duchesss constitutional position was made clear by the Regency Act 1830 which provided that she would become Regent if her daughter was still under eighteen at the time of her accession No piece of paper signed by Victoria could have altered the provisions of the ActThere are also occasional infelicities In one early scene we see Victoria and Albert playing chess while comparing themselves to pawns being moved around a chessboard a metaphor so hackneyed that the whole scene should have come complete with a Danger Major clich ahead warning Yet in spite of scenes like this I came to enjoy the film There were some good performances especially from Miranda Richardson as the scheming Duchess and Mark Strong as the obnoxious Conroy It is visually very attractive being shot in sumptuous style we have come to associate with British historical drama Jim Broadbent gives an amusing turn as King William although he does occasionally succumb to the temptation of going over the top Although not as disastrously over the top as he was in Moulin RougeThe main reason for the films success however is the performances of Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend as the two young lovers Victoria and Albert Blunt is probably more attractive than Victoria was in real life but in her delightful portrayal the Queen is no longer the old lady of the popular imagination the blackclad Widow of Windsor who was perpetually not amused but a determined strongminded and loving young woman Her love for Albert and their happy family life together was one of the main reasons why the monarchy succeeded in reestablishing itself in the affections of the British people With the exception of George III Victorias Hanoverian ancestors had been notoriously lacking in the matrimonial virtues Blunt and Friend make The Young Victoria a touching romance and a gripping human drama as well as an exploration of a key period in British history 810,1
Sunday would not be Sunday without an action movie and when you want intense combat you turn to Tom Berenger PlatoonHere he plays a sniper in the jungle going after rebels and drug lords Lifes a bitch so he gets a green office type Billy Zane to help on the missionThe film is in the hands of Luis Llosa who stunk up Anaconda he doesnt do much better here but Berenger makes the movie worthwhileSure it may be a little long who wants to see a lot of walking through the jungle but is is good tense action when the time is right,1
Bizarre Tobe Hooper exercise regarding an unfortunate young manBrad Dourifwith the ability to set people on fire This ability stems from parents who partook in atomic experiments in the 50s They die of Spontaneous Human Combustion and it seems that what Sam is beginning to suffer from derives by these pills his girlfriend LisaCynthia Baingives him to take for rough migraines In actuality Lisa was told to manipulate Sam into taking the pills by Lew OrlanderWilliam Prince pretty much the young mans father who raised him from a child Lew has benevolent planshe sees Sam as the first Atomic Man a pure killing machine in human form Sam never wanted this and will do whatever it takes to silence those responsible for his condition As the film goes Sams blood is slowly growing toxic green in color instead of red It seems that water and other substances which often put out fire react right the opposite when Sams uncontrollable outbursts of flame ignite Come to find out Lisa has Sams condition whose parents also dies from SHC Dr MarshJon Cypher someone who Sam has known for quite some time as his physician is to insert toxic green fluid into their bodies Im guessing to increase their levels of flame NinaMelinda Dillon sporting an accent that fades in and outwas Sams parents friend and associate on the experiments in the 50s who tries to talk things over with him regarding what is happening And RachelDey Youngis Sams exwife who may be working against her former husband with Lew and Marsh to harm him and LisaQuite a strange little horror flick filled with some pretty awful flameeffects Dourif tries to bring a tragic element and intensity to his character whose plight we continue to watch as his body slowly becomes toxic waste with fire often igniting from his orifices Theres this large hole in his arm that spits out flame like a volcano and a massive burn spot on his hand which increases in size over time Best scene is probably when director John Landis who portrays a rude electrical engineer trying to inform Sam to hang up because the radio program hes calling has sounded off for the night becomes a victim of SHC The flick never quite works because its so wildly uneven with an abrupt ridiculous finale where Sam offers to free Lisa of her fire by taking it from her,0
When the US entered World War I the government forced Hollywood to churn out propaganda films THE LITTLE American is probably the best of the lot because it stars Mary PickfordPickford plays a young woman torn between two men Jack Holt German and Raymond Hatton French but her decision is delayed because of the war as both men enlistWhen the ship Pickford is sailing on is sunk by the Germans think Lusitania because it is carrying munitions Pickford has a great scene as she stands on the lifeboat and yells at the German commander Later on of course she runs into both Holt and Hatton when she is being held as a war prisoner at a chteauDirector Cecil B DeMille provides one truly great scene in this film as Pickford and Holt are wandering through a bombedout village They pass a destroyed church of which only one wall remains standing Against the wall is a very large crucifix As they stand and watch the wall collapses but the Jesus figure remains suspended in mid air Its a very surreal moment in a film that is otherwise very straightforward and unartsyPickford is as always a pleasure to watch She was always a very natural actress who avoided the armwaving histrionics many other actors of the day used Shes also very very pretty Holt is very good here in a leadingman role Hatton is OK Among the list of name actors in extra parts are Wallace Beery Ramon Novarro Colleen Moore Ben Alexander Hobart Bosworth Norman Kerry Walter Long James Neill and Edythe ChapmanNot a great film but interesting to see US propaganda at work,1
Mann photographs the Alberta Rocky Mountains in a superb fashion and Jimmy Stewart and Walter Brennan give enjoyable performances as they always seem to do But come on Hollywood a Mountie telling the people of Dawson City Yukon to elect themselves a marshal yes a marshal and to enforce the law themselves then gunfighters battling it out on the streets for control of the town Nothing even remotely resembling that happened on the Canadian side of the border during the Klondike gold rush Mr Mann and company appear to have mistaken Dawson City for Deadwood the Canadian North for the American Wild WestCanadian viewers be prepared for a Reefer Madness type of enjoyable howl with this ludicrous plot or to shake your head in disgust,0
This movie had a lot of ups downsThe storyline is strong while telling the saga of Ma Barker growing up then her misadventures with her boys and the FBITheresa Russell is very talented and her beauty even shines through as Ma Barker in Public Enemies The Direction of Mark L Lester while not as good as in 85s Commando was still very interestingEric Roberts plays a shortlived part as a security guard turned thugand Mas Lover and Alyssa Milano plays a prostitute who hangs with the gang Frank Stallone plays a thug who helps out the gang while one of his exploits gets one of Mas boy into trouble he gets himself out in a final way so to speakI was perplexed intrigued captivated throughout this movieSo it makes me wonder what movie all these others who voted it so low watchedFor all those wonderingUmm the FBI was actually that bad in the beginning didnt have tommy guns like the outlaws had were thus at quite a disadvantage whenever they did get into shootouts with gangs of that eraSince everything I saw represented the 30s I felt it was more realistic than many other movies made portraying that eraIt is in may ways like a train wreck happeningYou dont want to watch but JUST have tooEnjoy,1
I think I watched a highly edited version because it wasnt nearly as graphic as I expected based on the other reviews that I have heardOther than 1 being written by the same person who wrote the original Emmanuelle 1974 Emmanuelle Arsan 2 the lead character being a sexually free spirit and 3 being set in the exotic locale of Asia Laure doesnt have the same flair as its predecessorI just found this film way too talky with philosophical topics that Im really not that interested in ie the voyeuristic open relationship between Laure and Nick Im just happy with whatever brings her pleasuresomething along those lines I cannot relate to this mentality and the filmcharacters dont really shed any lightThe second half about finding the Mara tribe just seemed as though it were a completely separate film One that I didnt care for By that time I was just hoping that it would turn into a porn so that at least it would keep my interestMaybe I just didnt get itIll leave it at that,0
Not only is this film entertaining with excellent comedic acting but also interesting politically It was made at the end of the Soviet Union but makes fun of the soviet mentality through and through The story is set during the early days of the soviet union and it questions the rationale behind the revolution both in cultural and practical terms Of course by the late 80s and early 90s the bizarre strictures of soviet society are already relaxed but the ideology and mentality is still alive and well and ready for some welldeserved deconstruction Happily all this deep philosophical commentary is wrapped in a funny and entertaining packageJur,1
The silent film the Pride of the Clan starring Mary Pickford was supposed to be set in a fictional island off the coast of Scotland In actuality most of the exterior shots were filmed in Marblehead Massachusett on Marblehead Neck near several rocky seaside geographic areas including the Churn and Castle Rock My initial interest in the film was because of two factors 1 the Marblehead film location in my hometown and 2 the fact that my grandmother Lizzette M Woodfin was hired as a standin for Mary Pickford during filming of several scenes including the cliff scene Both women were small 5 in stature and both my father and grandmother related the fact that she was a standin with her back to the camera for the cliff scene as part of the Chiefton filming set I just wanted to relate this story for future film historians and buffs The film itself my DVD copy is somewhat poor is very well done with lots of action and expressive acting including several scenes where Miss Pickford portrays a strong woman characterization I enjoyed it and would love to get a better copy of it although I am unsure whether one exists as I have seen in various movie sites that remaining copies are dark because of deterioration A very nice film of the silent genre with lots of action,1
Despite positive reviews and screenings at the international festivals this movie is not for everyoneThe story is very similar to other movies in which a teenage girl from the family of immigrants needs to overcome many common personal problems of her age and also to struggle against the pressure of ethnic traditions in her family She does that by choosing some kind of sport and with the help of a local boy that for some reason falls in love with her she confronts her problems and winsIn Girlfight its boxing in Bend it like Beckham its soccer and now its Kung FuBut Fighter is much inferior product than these two it was simply embarrassing to watch it Semra Turan the actress that playing the role of a teenage girl maybe can do a lot of things but one thing she cant do is to act Her presence on the screen is anemic and clumsy the dramatic situations in which she tries to show some emotions are dreadful her body and facial language are of amateur actress badly instructed by the director The rest of the cast is a little better but they just cannot save this clich movie with stereotypical characters and shallow plot Besides a few relatively good moments this movie has nothing new or interesting to offerEven the kung fu fighting is not a reason to watch this its just so boring The slow motion was really unnecessary the choreography was basic and lacked the inspiration and most of the kung fu scenes are just training or standing in all kind of kung fu positions not actually fighting Not to mention how ridiculous it looks when a small and skinny girl fights big and muscular boys and knocks them off their feet The only reason this movie has been noticed at all is because its European Its very easy to publicize this movie A first martial arts film from Denmark but dont be fooled its not Its just a drama about stupid teenage girl and her problems which are by the way not really convincingBad movie with embarrassing lines acting and story,0
Ive seen all 3 now I just cant believe how bad Naqoyqatsi is Not in comparison to the others but simply on its own merit or lack of I cant understand how the average rating for this movie is over 6 out of 10 I gave the first 2 movies 8 out of 10 They were thought provoking and beautifully done I gave this movie a rating of 1 If a 0 or negative number was available I would have given it that rating instead What a total waste of time it was watching this movie I thought after the first 30 minutes that I should turn it off but then I figured that it was just a very slow starting movie I thought the same thing after 45 minutes then 1 hour etc Then I realized that it wasnt going to get any betterIts very tedious to watch and without any redeeming qualities Dont take my word for it watch it yourself Be sure to see the first two movies before this one If you see this one first I can just about guarantee that youll never want to see the first two but they are definitely much much better than this piece of workThe best part of the movie is when the credits role at the end Thats when your penance on this earth is complete and you can foregoe 89 minutes in purgatory for the suffering that youve endured watching this film If God is truely merciful hell be more generous,0
I LOVED this movie when I was younger and I have actually been looking for it again I would love to watch it again The information is all correct but the cover doesnt look like it would match I cant say for sure though From what I remember the movie was about these kids Alyssa Milano Tina Yothers etc in a driving class and it also shows the mischief they get into outside the class Edie McClurg was Alyssa Milanos mother in the movie I remember I really liked it so if anyone knows where I can get a copy preferably DVD of the movie listed above with those stars in it I would love to know Thankyou,1
Her embalmed look was totally inappropriate for the role Her face remained too white hair too coifed clothes etc too clean and wellfitting especially her fathers old hat and coat in the scene where Inman comes home for any sense of accuracy It would be one thing if the production had allowed all the other actors to remain clean and perfect too but she was the only one who didnt get messy There was never even a smudge on her powdered cheek Are we to believe she was the only person in the Civil War with a bathtub and a mirror She certainly looked like the only one who used them Tweezers too I mean whats with those eyebrows She looked absolutely meanThe love story was implausible She only went over to the guy because someone told her that he had said he thought she was cute So she goes over to tease him then flirts with him a couple more times and suddenly this is a love on a par with Odysseus and Penelope PleaseI should have known better than to expect anything better from the man who brought us The English Patient My reaction to that one was the same as Elaines on Seinfeld It sucked,0
I would give this show a ten out of ten if it was not for the fart jokes You people are so damn sensitive it is inane So quick to point out the racism of the show and the jokes yet are also so quick to say ridiculously sexist pigheaded crap like well duh some of these other shows do these jokes so much better because at least they have hot women So disgusting Abortion jokes are great because really who takes abortion seriously anyways At least Im not aboreson I hear that Reba McEntire and Sarah Silverman are teaming up to do a movie about sisters taking a road trip together Talk about a movie of the year,1
The inspiration for this film was the fact that American Gangsters are well dresses but the Aussies well when you might kill a guy as soon as look at the blighter then you can dress as badly as you want and people wont criticize youJimmy is fighter an illegal boxer sometimes bouncer and is offered work by Pando the local gangster boss in the cross That is Australias notorious Kings Cross District not the Cross of London fame as many a British backpacker finds out the hard wayDue to feelings of love he stuffs up a job loses a lot of money and has to get it to Pando before Pando and his heavies can kill himLots of dark humour interesting action revelations about the Australias underside and human nature It is very centred in the Australian nature and explores the nature of Australian criminals versus the American and British onesOne problem is that each of the elements of the story dont have enough substance and depth but it is a painting with broad strokes that covers a lot of area not covered previously so as an overall package it is worthwhileTeam it up with Chopper and Dirty Deeds for your Aussie Crime fest or Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Millers Crossing for an International falling short of the criminal gangs festBy the way Bryan Brown is a great actor who has just done a huge number of really bad movies Here is one of his great movies,1
With a well thought out cast this movie was a great comedic relief The plot is wellwritten and the cast was knockout Every bit as good as the reviews suggested a rarity and was highly entertaining Being a huge John Candy fan myself this movie was no disappointment,1
If you havent watched the movie yet but you do like comedy go out and buy or at least rent it The fact it won the animation Oscar is not a coincidence I havent watched many other Wallace Gromit movies in fact I think I only watched one other but the humor is very distinctive and some would also say very British In a good way of course The story will only be an excuse for all the jokes to come but although its not the most elaborate one it still works by the way my niece did guess see one of the big surprises coming I didnt Kudos to her o I do think that after you watch this one youll go out and seek the other WG movies that are out there Have fun,1
I really loved this original screenplay and the different places it took me emotionally spiritually and just plain silly stuff I didnt get caught up in believability in the screenplay or the actors and didnt even think about it until reading the reviews listed here in IMDb for the movie Listening to Michael Parness talk at the Q A about his idea of the film wanting to see how crazy people or fed up people as he put it fall in love is really interesting I identified with not having a story book romance and liked seeing dysfunction at its best I like watching David Krumholtz in anything he does and have followed his career for a few years now I believe this is some of his best work and say to anyone just see this film to watch an amazing young actor I agree that Guillermo Daz really was a scene stealer and what he did with his character is really a great acting lesson in commitment I laughed and cried both in this movie and was disappointed that it didnt win any awards at the festival I question why that didnt happen I gave Max and Grace a ten because these interesting unique creative Indie films deserve an audience Technically watching this film its really beautifully done the colors are amazing and lastly its one of the best soundtracks I have heard in a film in awhile,1
I rented this film from Blockbust because of the Cover and Title Sounded intriguing This movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense The monsters needed more face time We needed them to have some sort of special power and definitely more Oh Sh moments The photography didnt bother me except for the scene where a rebreather blows up There were too many close ups But other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom Overall I would say everyone put in a lot of time even the writers But this movie is definitely a below average rentThere are definitely better picks I would recommend Anacondas 1 or 2 over this pick,0
I read Schneebaums book same title as this film when it was first published and was deeply moved by his ability to see through the many ways of otherness his own and the people of the Amazon with whom he lived and loved to a way of living a decent life His subsequent books were not as powerful but showed his continuing quest His description of his sexual relations with the men of the tribe was way ahead of its time in the early 60s but his honesty and openness about it were welcome This movie beautifully conveys both the quirkiness and generosity of the man but also provides a glimpse into the inevitable destruction of innocence which is not a morally positive term in this case that occurs when civilized men intrude on traditional societies Even so Schneebaum himself has moved into a kind of higher innocence that suggests the possibility of saving humanity from its own destructiveness,1
An opium den a dirty little boy actually a midget prostitutes galore a violent fracas in a dive a motel for sexual shenanigans scantily clad babes with cleavage a lot a boozer falling down the stairs a racially mixed clientle in a bar with Asians Africans and Anglos treated equally does this sound like a film playing at the local shopping mall Wrong These are all scenes from a 1933 musicalThe first half of Footlight Parade is preparation for a musical extravaganza which occupies the last half of the film Chester Kent Cagney is about to lose his job and does lose his playgirl wife as a result of talking pictures squeezing out live stage musicals His producers take him to see a popular talky of the day John Wayne in The Big Trail Before each showing of the flick a dance number is presented as a prologue Shorts news reels serials and cartoons would later serve the purpose Kent gets the idea that a prologue chain would be the road to salvation for the dwindling live musical business Kent is basically an idea man along the lines of choreographer Busby Berkeley Could it be that Cagneys character is patterned after Berkeley Could be In preparation for the prologues Kent learns that his ideas are being stolen by a rival He uncovers the traitor fires him then unbeknown to him a new leak is planted in the form a dazzling temptress His assistant Nan Prescott Joan Blondell soon to be Mrs Dick Powell has the hots for Kent and is determined to expose the wiles of the temptress A new singer from Arkansas College shows up in the form of Scotty Blain Dick Powell who turns out to be a real find and is paired with Bea Thorn Ruby Keeler The resulting three prologue musicals which couldnt possibly have been presented on any cinema stage of the day are as fresh and enjoyable today as they were over seventy years ago Honeymoon Hotel By a Waterfall and Shanghai LilOf special note is the song and dance of toughguy James Cagney Like Fred Astaire and Bill Bojangles Robinson Cagneys dancing appeared natural and unrehearsed although hours went into practice to get each step just right Not as good a singer as Astaire Cagneys singing like Astaires sounded natural unlike the crooning so popular at the time Its amazing that one person could be so talented and so versatile as James CagneyMost critics prefer the Shanghai Lil segment over the other two Yet the kaleidoscopic choreography of By a Waterfall is astonishing How Berkeley was able to film the underwater ballets and to create the human snake chain must have been difficult because it has never been repeated The close up shots mixed brilliantly with distant angles is a mustsee The crisp black and white photography is much more artistic than it would have been if shot in color Though not nearly as socially conscious as Gold Diggers of 1933 Footlight Parade stands on its own as one of the most amazing and outrageous musicals ever put on the big screen,1
Meanspirited ugly nasty retroaction thriller about a bodyguard who is determined to find and destroy the killers of the girl he was supposed to protect This film is almost an anachronism in todays politically correct atmosphere Director Scott doesnt have any desire to apologize for the inherently immorality behind the films dramatic structure Scott is either not aware or doesnt care for 30 years of social advances I really dont think we will see a more violent film any time soon so you better go and see this one while you can Despite its relentless grimness I think the movie is a powerful example of cinema at its most sinister exploitative and effective Scott has a tough thing to sell but I think Im a buyer The extraordinary technical aspects of this film are just too effective for me to ignore Scotts directorial choices are simply astonishing and he pulls a great performance out of Denzel Washington Sensitive souls need to stay away from this one but I recommended it to those viewers looking for a great actionfilled movie,1
Movie Title TartDate of review 52602Year of movie 2001Stars Dominique Swain Brad Renfro Bijou Phillips barely Melanie Griffith barelyNeCRos Rating 4 skulls out of 10May Contain spoilersPlotAn outcast Dominique Swain wants to be with the in group and so she abandons her real friends and joins themmuch annoying rich people talk occurs Actingugh I guess I got what I wanted in that Dominique was ok but man the rest of the cast besides maybe Brad Renfro were bad or at least not interesting or likable at all I know some could say that the others were good because they made me hate themtrust meI like unlikable chars but this group is unlikable because they cant convincingly be bad peopleIt figures that the only other people I got this for were barely even in it and that is Melanie Griffith and Bijou Phillips but the little time they had they were ok Melanie spoke maybe 2 lines but at least Bijou had a good character although smallViolence and GoreMy mind was constantly under attack from horrid dialogue and very very annoying characters thats violence enough ok there was one bludgeoning with a rock which was okTA Nudity Factorhahaha they couldnt even add in any nudity to help spice up this movie probably because no one would want to bear their body for this crap If they are going to expose themselves they should do it in a movie where they will be remembered as their character and not for oh hey I heard she gets naked in this oneOverall View of the movie reviewok ok I know I pride myself on being the person who can like most if not almost all movies or at least find some good in it Well this movie is one of the few I really struggled to find anything worth while in The problem with this movie is that it is so damn annoying I already have a deep hatred for snobby rich people attitudes and that didnt help either All this movie really is is just a bunch of rich people sitting around acting depressed and stupid I cant stress the annoyance factor enough This movie tries to rehash the tried and true In group plotline which can usually be done ok with little difficultyWhy do I not have a pic from the movie or the box cover Well I felt this movie didnt deserve that glory so I decided to put a pic of the reason I rented this and that reason is none other than Dominique Swain Yes I too was wooed by her in Lolita and thought she was so good that I decided from then on to check her out in any movie in which she acts At least I keep my promises and yes I have seen the majority of her movies minus a few hard to find ones She herself is a great actress and I would defend her actively but man she chooses some of the crappiest movies to star in This movie and Smokers are both in the same boat of crappiness but at least Smokers had a cool idea for a story and even some real good scenesAlso the dvd box tries to fool you into thinking that this movie has stars as well in it by putting Melanie Griffith and Bijou Phillips names on the front of the box If theres one thing that PS me off its a movie that plasters the names of stars on a box to make you think wow it has I wonder how good is in this one I saw in that movie and thought she was great only to have the big names in the movie for a total of maybe 10 minutes between the 2 Bijou actually had a part that semimeant something Melanie on the other hand only has 2 lines about Granted I dont like Melanie that much but this is about ethics and not star actingOut of all this mess though props must go to Brad Renfro for turning in an ok performance along with Dominique Brad may be one very messed up kid in real life but at least he can act So the only reason this movie gets any skulls is because I got what I basically wanted which was Dominique Swain and Brad Renfro Also I had the added pleasure of seeing underrated actress Bijou Phillips make me like her even more So even though I was annoyed throughout I still came out with some positives although this was pretty hard this timeI recommend you to ONLY see this if youve seen Lolita and know how good Dominique is or if you are some offbeat fan of Brad or Bijou Uber Melanie fans will be sorely depressed Also if youre a fan of crappy movies like me please do not assume this be a guilty pleasure because you will feel guilty alright for the money spent on buying or rentingSome movies are so bad that they are good as the saying goes What they forgot to add was so bad that they are good to pass upNeCRo,0
Perhaps Disney was hoping for another Mary Poppins but this is a very different story and while Angela is delightful she was a very different performer to the great Julie Andrews Having said that Lansbury is perfectly cast and delivers a magical performance There is something deliciously dotty about her character and she is given wonderful support by David Tomlinson Tomilinson can carry a tune but he is certainly not much chop as a singer It does not matter he was such a gifted actor you hardly notice There are some great cameos from much loved stars of another time like Roddy McDowel who gives a winning performance and the much loved Tessie OShea who does very little but its nice to see the old gal again Its also lovely to see Sam Jaffe and the king of English television Bruce Forsythe in small roles The score has a couple of beautiful songs especially The briny sea and The age of Not Believing The big number Portabello Road is stretched to the limit but it has plenty of theatricality The effects look a bit clich today but the scene with the German invaders being attacked by the wildest army in film is pretty impressive The kids are not as annoying as other movies but one does struggle to understand what the youngest boy is saying I loved the marching song of the home army The home guard were very important to Britain and this is a warm tribute The animation is delightful much better than Pixar which I find grotesque A warm happy film and its a wonder its not done on stage,1
I came to NEW PORT SOUTH expecting a surrogate movie about the Columbine school massacre similar to Gus Van Sants ELEPHANT and certainly the synopsis in the TV guide stating that a student sociopath rebels against the system did give me that impression but this is a very boring movie where little happens so consider yourself warned The story is about Maddox a Chicago high school student who decides to strike back at what he perceives to be an authoritarian regime The major problem is that the character is underwritten and the actor who plays him Blake Shields is unable to embellish any script deficiencies You have the gut feeling that Maddox should have the evil charisma of Hitler Saddam or Bin Laden but he never comes across as anything more than a petulant truculent teenager and its impossible to believe he could rally any disciples The subtext of you overthrow one manipulative authoritarian regime only to replace it with another manipulative regime is too obvious which means NEW PORT SOUTH is an entirely unconvincing drama thats not worth going out of your way to see,0
Can I Do it till I Need Glasses at the very least proves the point that anyone can make a movie Talent is not a consideration The folks who unleashed this wretched pile of spewing vomit upon the world lack any semblance of talent taste or intelligence The target audience must consist of the recently labotimized and infants who play with their own feces Anyone else would be far too world wise to get even a snicker out of this film It consists of a series of sophmoric skits in which the punchline does not even extend to the obvious It ends at the ludicrous The jokes told are the types of jokes that elementary school children tell usually potty or sexually related where they dont know the meaning of all of the terms they use You know like the one about daddys car and mommys garage To apply any sterner method of criticism would be pointless since the usual standards of acting writing direction and such have never even been heard of by the creative minds behind this mess Not to be judgemental but anyone who enjoyed this film should seriously reflect upon their purpose on this earth,0
Jack Brooks Trevor Matthews is a college student with some severe anger issues His family was brutally murdered when he was a child by a monster and now he takes out his anger on everything and everyoneSo when his professor Robert Englund begins to show signs of monsterism he learns he has to control his rage and use it for good instead of evil and fight the creatures that have been haunting his nightmares ever since that fateful nightTruly earns its Brated rating but what was cool about it was that it didnt focus on crappy Brated CGI graphics In fact 0 of the film was CGI The monsters were actually decently put together and although the storyline was lacking it was somewhat watchableif for only one time,0
The surprise nominee of this years Best Animated Feature race at the Oscars Its an Irish film by heart but it was coproduced by Belgium and Brazil with Im guessing animators working in all three countries The product is one of the most beautiful and unique films in recent memory The character design is a little reminiscent of the French animated film Persepolis from a couple of years back with very simple characters with thick black outlines This film is not in black and white Oh no What makes this film great is its use of color simply some of the most outrageous and startling use of colors Ive ever seen The general design of the pictures is also a lot more geometrical with characters who are basically rectangles or ovals Much of the film can be spent playing find the circle a major aspect of the visual design is a circle in the center of the image All of these geometrical designs have a purpose the story is about a young boy who is learning to be an artist working on illuminated manuscripts the Book of Kells is a real illuminated Bible the art of the film is based on the drawings in it The story of the film isnt especially deep but its a pretty good fantasy tale Brendan is a young boy in Kells a city surrounded by enormous walls built by his uncle to keep out Vikings A newcomer to Kells Brother Aiden inspires Brendan to take up illustrating He also inspires him to do things like leave Kells and explore the nearby forest within which lives a nymph Bruno Coulais provides a fantastic score almost as good as the one he did for Coraline which I consider the very best of the year,1
Shtrafbat Penal Battalion is a moving and mostly honest look at the lives and deaths of Soviet soldiers who were sentenced to wash away their crimes with blood during World War Two One can almost call it the Russian equivalent of highly acclaimed Band of Brothers miniseriesFormed in July of 1942 on the eve of Battle of Stalingrad the penal battalions were considered expendable units and suffered horrible casualties sometimes as high as 90 Prisoners of GULAG political prisonconcentration camps deserters soldiers who were captured by Germans but managed to escape soldiers accused of breaching protocol were all given a chance to join the Shtrafbat and prove that there were not Traitors of the Motherland with their lives Those who sustained injuries and those who died in battle were considered rehabilitated and were reinstated in the eyes of the lawThis miniseries features a look at one such Shtrafbat under the command of Tverdokhlebov an honorable officer who was captured by the Germans was shot and left for dead It features a colorful and varied group of people thrust into a situation from which there is no escape The authoritative yet honorable crime boss Antip Kulak The Fist and his little gang of unreformed criminals a young Jewish intellectual who struck his antiSemite officer Father Orthodox Priest Mikhail who joins the battalion when his parish is destroyed in the housetohouse fighting political prisoners who hate the regime that condemned them to the GULAG but who are nonetheless willing to fight one last time for their people and country must all find their courage and their reasons to keep on living and to keep on fightingAlthough set during a war not every episode features combat in fact what combat scenes there are are often chaotic sporadic and short which was probably the intent of the director In between the miniseries focuses on various relationships between the cast their backgrounds their thoughts and tragedies The rape of a young woman by one of Shtrafbats soldier and then his execution execution for supposed AWOL periods of boredom on the march the celebration and subsequent consequences of finding a German bunker stocked with food and champagne the moral dilemma of officers unable to save their men from their own superiors cheating on a spouse and other situations feature prominently The camera is unflinching it does not turn away from the ugliness of war and the ugliness of human nature nor from raw human emotions The dialog likewise does not censor out the swearingThe acting is superb and deep and the script is likewise well written Everything from rage to weariness to resignation to finding a scrap of joy to hang on to is rendered almost faultlessly One complaint might be that some of Russian linguistic and cultural idiosyncrasies may not always be understood by someone not familiar with the language and culture Because it is a history drama in a sense some of the terms and situations military rank mention of other battles certain historical references may be lost on some viewers This understanding is not needed to thoroughly enjoy Shtrafbat but these references are a nice touch of authenticity Another complain that could be levied is an occasional anachronism and bending of history to suit the plot but frankly this is such a riveting miniseries that one will likely forgive these slight mishaps,1
Dear Mr Dante Dude seriously the title of the show is Masters of Horror And be that as it may it is supposed to be an opportunity to show of your horror chops to show the world why you deserve to be called a master of the genre Appearantly you misunderstood the exercise Appearantly you thought it was your opportunity or worse your duty to educate the American public on your political beliefs And your attempt comes off as disgusting overbearing and above all preachyThe only reason ANYONE marked your short as a high score is because their political views match yours and they are the type of people that dont mind having that sort of politics shoved down their throatI on the other hand dont give a damn what you believe they believe or I believe I just want such obvious not subtle and unfunny not satire messages out of my horror And while there were certainly other Masters of Horror that were big time disappointments or where I was just generally confused why that director william malone would be considered a genre master yours fails far beyond the rest for just missing the entire point of the seriesSo next time can you please just keep your preachy politics to yourself,0
Mike Nichols in finest form I was not a fan of Closer so its refreshing to see him again right back on top with this comedy set in the darkest of circumstances Just one slip in tone could have wrecked this compelling picture but Nichols and his very strong Alist cast never put a foot wrong in this biopic of a deeply flawed but utterly compelling CongressmanPhilip Seymour Hoffman as usual is scintillating and brilliant here playing a damaged but ultrasmart CIA manipulator and it is in the exchanges between Hanks and Hoffmans characters where the comedy soars Rarely is movie humour laughout loud and also smart This hits the spot time after time with a biting satirical edge that makes you both laugh and weep at the state of the world often simultaneouslyOne other major plus is the length of the picture The film is based on George Criles fat book of the same title The temptation for screenwriter Aaron Sorkin his claim to fame is The West Wing must have been to make a fat movie but what we get is a breathtaking 90 odd minutes of great story with sweeping implicationsThis film deserves to be seen and to be recognized for finding an extraordinary balance between the darkest of dark subject matter and the lightness of touch of its sparkling witty script even if it does flunk the obvious link between the help that Herring and Wilson provide and the ultimate consequences 911,1
What is there to say about an antiestablishment film that was produced in a time of such colourless void social indifference and authoritarian contentment Cassevettes first major independent film was not an instant box office success and still has not received the critical attention it deserves I draw comparisons to this wave of American independent projects consisting of such Beat filmmakers as Robert Frank and Harry Smith with the burgeoning scene emerging in Paris in the late 1950s known as the French new waveThey discussed poetry and philosophy and vulnerability at a time when the rest of the culture was obsessed with rediscovering American cultural supremacy even at this stage this peculiar highly spontaneous brand of filmmaking fought against the establishment of such political lexicons and bigots that held the development of the arts in check in the mid twentieth centuryCassevettes film examines race relations and portrays man as weak in the face of love because we as a culture are blinded by our own race bias and prejudice The great element to most of Cassevettes work is that his films have almost a reversal minimalist effect a mental reaction is evoked through subtle character relations not so much imagery This is why his work seems to linger because he takes a more intimate approach to defining charcters that rely less heavily on explicit actions and more upon interpretationAlthough my favourite Cassevettes film is Husbands this one is his most important,1
With Pep Squad receiving an average of 47 on IMDbcom no wonder Steve Balderson slanders this website so But the fact is that Pep Squad is a poorly crafted black comedy both words in quotation marks for a reason Its a movie full of overacting Cherry Beths Mother coupled with a couple of lethargic performances Beth and Julies boyfriend A movie where you can follow cars from twenty feet away in a gaudy red Jeep and never be noticed A movie chock full of notsoappetizing cleavage and nudity shots that make you wonder Does the director think this is funny Or clever Most of all the characters are so paperthin and poorly developed that the film becomes quite unpredictable but probably not on purpose Pep Squad cant decide whether to be a comedy or a drama or a satire patriotic music I get it The movie fails at being serious because the idea of killing for any school position this being Prom Queen crosses the line into insanity not to mention shots of flag burning and driveby shootings a poor attempt at being controversial and edgy and fails at being a comedy for all the forced and awkwardly placed jokes big butt mama funky black principal and excessive cussing delivered poorly by the principal cast Watching the documentary Wamego Making Movies Anywhere only made this film more cringeworthy with praise lauded towards it by the director and the directors father hmmmmmm Not a black comedy or anything for that matter I guess Kansas will have to wait,0
Although the casting for this film was admirable particularly Dianne Keaton and Tom Everett Scott the quality of the writing was so poor that it would be impossible for any actor or director to make this film worth watchingMy wife and I decided that the reason we watched the entire film was that it was like a train wreck and it was almost impossible to turn away It may have been that we hoped that the message would eventually make itself apparent and that we would be able to glean some meaning from this effort Unfortunately this did not happenOf course the audience may have been able to make sense of this convoluted tale a credit to the ingenuity of the human brain to make sense of the absurd The writers however did NOTHING to facilitate this innate need we seem to have for finding meaningIt was apparent that those involved were simply going through the motions of their respective crafts and that any intrinsic passion for the characters or the story was either secondary or nonexistentUnfortunately madeforTV movies have seemed to devolve over the years Whereas communicating a message to the audience may to have been the primary interest of the writers in the past presentday writers and producers seem condescending to their audience concentrating primarily on manipulating us to staytuned through the incessant advertising which seems to be the only reason movies such as Surrender Dorothy are made,0
Well well well As good as John Carpenters season 1 outing in Masters of Horror was this is the complete opposite He certainly proved he was still a master of horror with Cigarette Burns but ProLife is perhaps the worst I have seen from himIts stupid totally devoid of creepy atmosphere and tension and it overstays its welcome despite the lessthananhour running time The script is nonsense the characters are irritable and unappealing and the conclusion is beyond absurdAnd for those suckers who actually bought the DVD one of them being me did you see how Carpenter describes the film Hes actually proud of it and he talks about it as his best work for a long time and he praises the script And in the commentary track where he notices an obvious screw up that made it to the final cut he just says he didnt feel it essential to rectify the mistake and he just let it be there I fear the old master has completely lost his touch I sincerely hope Im proved wrongI want to leave on a positive note and mention that the creature effects are awesome though Technically speaking this film is top notch with effective lighting schemes and make up effects,0
My friends and I saw the movie last night in Austin at a showing for AGLIFF a film festival This movie was one of the best Ive seen this year It was a great comedy very original and heartfelt and FUNNY AS HELL Everyone in the audience was laughing throughout the entire movie Texas is a big state with LOTS of small towns and of course plenty of teenagers who grew up as fat girls I know a lot of people will relate to this film on a personal level Ashley Fink and Robin de Jesus were awesome they were so great in these rolls it was like the script was written with them in mind And speaking of the script it was very well written very believable and Ash is a great actor his facial expressions alone made me giggle It IS an independent film but dont let that fool youIts a good one Seeing this caliber of work from someone so young is truly inspiring,1
Ive seen comments from Turkish people which Im not saying this movie is fantastic and accurately portrays Turkish life All I have to say is Turkey must be one of the most boring and depressing places in the world because in my opinion that is exactly what this movie was to me If I were Turkish I think it would have had a greater impact But if youre not from Turkey I would advise you not to waste two hours of your life on thisDistant seems to lag on forever Many scenes are painstakingly long with little or no purpose I dont understand the directors objectives in even including many of the scenes It is pointed out that the director used his own car apartment and friends in making the movieWell guess what It shows It looks low budget The acting is poor If its a cultural thing then so be it I just dont understand the purpose of basing a movie on this story Its unbelievably boring,0
I use IMDB very much Mainly reading comments of other people about movies Ive or not seen Ive thought it was time to write a few words about this movie that changed my life and the way I look a movie I think I have seen it at least a dozen times since autumn 94 when I saw it in the theatre for the first timeI feel Kieslowski is one of the best directors of all time And I think this is his best one It was his last one I was very sad the day I knew he has died because sure we lost the chance to get something more from himRED is just the best Kieslowski incredibile performance by Trintignant Jacob cinematography by Sobocinski If you havent seen it LOOK FOR it If you have just come back to itRed just a masterpiece please forgive my poor English reader,1
Some weeks ago at a movie theater I saw a movie poster of El Padrino 2004 with the tag The Latin Godfather How lame have we become I thought Latin just because he is a Mexican Let me remind you that ANYTHING Latin comes from or is related to Latium Italy So the original guy in the Godfather movie is more Latin than the Mexican Godfather and this is why We are called LatinAmerican people because we speak Spanish a language based in the Latin language that originated in Rome now Italy So to place a tag in a movie poster like The Latin Godfather is not just ignorant of course if we are trying to related this movie to the original Godfather but a desperate and uncreative attempt to get some credit by copying the title of a movie classic Now about the movie I just hate overacting so from 1 to 10 I guess is 3 the most,0
I happened upon this by chance I was at my friends house and he had just started watching it so I sat down thinking we would shoot the breeze whilst this was playing in the background However within seconds I was immersed in this docudrama and we both spent the rest of the time completely focused on this and not saying a word to each other I never knew the tale of the the first solo around the world yacht race let alone the tragic events of one mans attempt against the odds which set out to be his redemption for all of his misfortunes in life but ultimately ends up becoming an example of them Having not known of the story I did watch this with the same fervor as I imagine those who were reading about the race at the time it actually was happening engulfed in what was taking place and eager for more information hoping the lone amateur was going to pull it off against the odds and beat the pros which makes the shocking twists of the story all the more tragic I felt like I was living the storyThe story is told with great care and the interviewees have clearly had time to reflect on the tragedy which gives great insights but is also contrasted nicely by the archive footage of interviews at the time of the tragedy the recordings and photographs of the lone sailors is also excellently used and the insights into the minds of the sailors and how solitude was affecting them was superbIm shocked that this story isnt more widely known or has been turned into a movie but also thankful Thankful that we have this dramadocumentary to tell the tale from those who knew the man instead of some wishywashy movie adaptation and thankful that I caught this gem of a film by pure chance Its a must see whether you like documentaries or not,1
There was a time when Michael Jackson was revered as the King of Pop Then came a time when he attracted negative publicity as much as lemonade attracts wasps Finally it is now the time that we feel truly sorry for this manThis movie is another reason to I promised a rabid Michael Jackson fan to watch it with her You know the type of fan someone who tells him or herself to like everything the object of affection ever did While watching this movie which she had seen twice already I realized how far this fandom goes Probably far enough to rate this movie above a 110 as some people miraculously didThe movie attempts to be a parody of many other movies and series most notably Cast Away Lost and Jurassic Park Unfortunately it fails miserably at any level The acting does not save the absolutely horrible story the filming has the quality of a toooften played video tape the special effects were better executed in Be Kind Rewind for those who do not now this movie with aluminum foil All this would be funny if the movie managed to be well funny Unfortunately it is not It hurts to watch thisAnd then there is Michael Jacksons appearance in this garbage He appears on a projection screen to deliver an important message and manages to come across as mobile as Jabba the Hutt and as serious as a 4year old Just when I thought who is the terrible person that lured this poor man into participating in this movie and yet again making a total fool of himself I finally reached the ending credits and discovered that the movie was actually partially shot at Jacksons Neverland ranch In other words He Likes ItThis movie and Jacksons involvement in it is truly disturbing Do not watch it even for the haha a movie in the IMDb Bottom 100 effect Or be warned,0
Its difficult to put into words the almost seething hatred I have of this film But Ill tryEvery other word was an expletive the sex scenes were uncomfortable drugs were rampant and stereotyping was beyond the norm if not offensive to ItalianAmericansIm not saying the acting was terrible because Leguizamo Sorvino Brody Espisito et al performed well Butalmost every character in the film I despised Not since The Bonfire of the Vanities have I disliked every character on screen,0
Worst film ever this is a statement that people here on IMDb often throw around Whether its an Uwe Boll movie bad classics like Manos The Hands Of Fate or the latest no brains summer action fest from Michael Bay people are often quick to jump to the sudden conclusion that on the board theyre posting that there is nothing worse in the movie worldI envy these people because theyre blissfully ignorant and unaware of how deep the rabbit hole of crap movie making really goes There are films out there so bad so hideous so unintentionally hilarious and so ridiculous that cults form around them to celebrate their awfulness and their discussion boards are the kindest places on the internet due to everyone agreeing unanimously that said film is really that badLadies and Gentlemen i present to you Ben and Arthur an 85 minute gay epic that is so utterly bad that its a lot like a violent car crash you know its awful but you cant stop looking at it The brainchild of self proclaimed hollywood actor director and may i add beached whale Sam Mraovich this film is legendarily terrible Let me give you a hint of how ego driven this project was Mr Mraovich not only directed this film he wrote it produced it executive produced it scored it edited it and then finally starred in it This is a man so blinded by his own ego and so believing of his non existent genius that like someone with an ugly child he fails to recognise just how catastrophic his bastard creation really isEverything in this film fails on an epic level the acting is the worst you will ever witness the plot is the most ridiculous the editing and cinematography is the most amateur and even the music is like nails on a chalkboard Im aware ive gone on a bit of a tangent here but please believe me that this film is really as bad as i describe it i would say this film is horse crap squished into a film reel but the truth is it wasnt even shot on film it was shot on a digital camcorder not much better than the one sitting in your closet right now gathering dust Dont get me wrong i forgive low budgets for films provided the concept is interesting for example as much as i disliked it The Blair Witch Project proved that low budgets can still lead to an atmospheric interesting film Ben and Arthur does not have a good concept to fall back on even if this film was shot on a budget of 20 million with Hollywoods finest actors it would still suck the plot is that atrocious and the characters are even worse One of the main characters Arthur who is portrayed by non other than Sam Mraovich is one of the most whiny loathsome little turds ever put in a film Youll dislike him within 5 minutes of the start of the film and by the end of the film that hate will have turned into outright loathing Apparently Mr Mraovich forgot that were supposed to root for the heroI dont want to spoil all the gut busting hilarity youll experience watching this film which i urge you not to pay for so i will give you two tame mild examples of how stupid this film is tame and mild as in amongst the least offending mistakes in the movie In one cut we hear one of the main characters say how they know a good lawyer and will give HIM a call the shot fades out then fades back in and this HIM they spoke of earlier is actually a woman quite a spectacular mistake to make in post production i think The second is simple seconds after seeing this transsexual lawyer the characters are told to fly to Vermont we then cut to a shot of a plane landing amongst palm trees in a sunny area Ive never been to Vermont personally but im certain you wont find any palm trees thereImagine this kind of stupid amateur inconsistency stretched to nearly an hour and a half combined with ridiculous dialogue and plot and then multiply it by 10 and it still wont fully prepare you for Ben and Arthur Imagine the absolute worst film youve seen in your life and imagine it being even worse and you still wont be on the same level as Ben and Arthur this film is really that badHowever we should be glad in a way films like this are a true rarity They give us hope that one day we can become film makers ourselves or that we can be screenwriters Simply because well have a new found sense of confidence due to the fact that well know that nothing we produce no matter how amateur could be as much of a suck fest as thisThe real worst movie of all time has finally been discovered and it is called Ben and Arthur,0
In Red Letters Coyote is at the vortex of as a college professor who writes to a female prison inmate and gets more than he bargained for There are two reasons to watch this flickKinski is one and Piven the other although its difficult for their sparks to shine in such a complete directorial disaster Everything is wrong with Red Lettersconvoluted lousy screenplay camera editing and most of all acting which is subpar for Coyote etc Battersby has taken a story with potential and turned it into a seriously flawed and amateurish flick not worth the time,0
Piece of subtle art Maybe a masterpiece Doubtlessly a special story about the ambiguity of existence Tale in Kafka style about impossibility of victory or surviving in a perpetual strange world The life is in this film only exercise of adaptation Lesson about limits and original sin about the frailty of innocence and error of his waysLeopold Kessle is another Joseph K Images of Trial and same ambiguous woman And Europa is symbol of basic crisis who has many aspects like chimeric wars or unavailing search of truthessencegolden ageMethaphor or parable the movie is history of disappointeds evolution War peace business or lie are only details of gelatintime Hypocrisy is a mask Love a convention The sacrifice only method to hope understanding a painful reality,1
I must say I found this movie very disappointing Yes I know Maltin gave it 3 12 and others think very highly of it But well the opera sequences were godawful I take it Jeannete MacDonald is an acquired taste Yes in the short sequences I have seen her with Nelson Eddy she is immensely preferable to him But on her ownGod I dislike opera and despise operetta and she is basically intolerable At one point I had to cover my ears Gable is just OK and Tracy is thrown away The plot is annoying in the JM never simply tells Gable she loves him and the opera and why cant she do both Instead she suffers silently or not so with the compromises she makes The supporting cast is distinctly unmemorable Besides the star three and Jack Holt and I suppose his mother they all are just background and forgettable The EQ sequence is the only thing that saves the movie And just Yes it is fairly spectacular and moving But the oh God is great seems very contrived I immensely prefer In Old Chicago as far as old time disaster spectaculars go Spare yourself on this one,0
Okay its too long and its too satisfied with itself Still The Great Dictator is a fascinating movie Chaplin does a terrific job satirizing Hitler and trying to portray the oppression of the Jews in Nazi Germany this was before the concentration camps were common knowledge Not a Chaplin masterpiece but still worth seeing,1
This is the only Christopher Guest movie that rivals Spinal Tap and Princess Bride for sheer entertainment value but somehow never gets near the recognition The plot surrounds the contestantsdogsand their owners as they venture into the world of competitive dogOK its about a dog show The owners truly are characters as one would have to be to be so attached to their dogs Thats really all there is to it but that makes it funny enoughYoud never be able to convince me that a mockumentary about dog shows would be funny prior to catching the hilarious scene where Levy and Ohara visit Larry Millers house on TVbut thats really all it takes to convert any doubters Spinal Tap was nonstop hilarity joke after joke whereas Best in Show was had a few more lulls and by that I mean say 3 minute at MOST where something riotously funny doesnt happen but the big laughs are even biggerThe casting in this one is great and even the typically out of place in uh movies in general Parker Posey does a fine job In fact her tirade directed at Ed Begley Jr and a pet store owner over a lost dog toy is probably the funniest running gag of the filmWhats amazing about this movie to me is how the writers somehow managed to weave a plot simple as it was around these great jokes so that it actually felt like it had direction I guess theres a freedom in having such a minimal plot Everyones role is pretty well crafted here and the characters are rarely overthetop The realism of how pathetic they seem to the outsider is what makes it funnier than Mighty Wind or the uneven Guffman I actually encounter wierdos like this now and then If you like Guests stuff at all you should definitely own this one,1
Ive seen worse which is a backhanded way of saying how crummy this film was The plot is ridiculous a student shoots a police officer and five more take him hostage In a dimlylit smoky New York school and somehow this clichd hostage situation takes 24 hours to resolve Are you serious A daylong hostage situation with a wounded NYPD officer no less takes all day I realize this film was made pre911 but still I looked at the clock and wondered how they could possibly drag this overdone plot on for another hour and 10 minutesThe acting was mediocre at best allaround and the characters were seemingly thought up by 7th graders The childabuse kid the pregnant scared girl the violent gang wannabe a confused unfortunate victim the wisecracking white guy PleaseTrying to make this hostage situation into a mission for more textbooks and better school conditions Please this is a weak attempt to justify writing a movie about a kid who shoots a cop Theyre confused ignorant idiots who get involved in a dumb farfetched situation Dont try and paint them suddenly as noble The most laughable is Ziggy who lives in the schools attic and admires Michaelangelo so much so that he paints these striking scenes on the walls Youve got to be kidding meThe no racism signs in the protesting crowd A black kid shoots a black cop and a black negotiator tries to patch it all up This is a random messageI understand the overall message which was poorly portrayed albeit by some actors who have gone on to respectable careersThis was a joke though the red sniper lasers on the roof The worst scene was the kid fake snow falling dying in the arms of his buddy on the roof promise me etc How originalThe epilogue of I went to prison but now Im prelaw at XYZ University a fitting way to end a joke of a movie,0
The movie is actually too slow There are some nice images but it cannot outweigh the fact that the movie is in fact boring You see a sexual intercourse a lot of watermelons and a sexual intercourse while eating a melon and maybe a little bit more It may sound even interesting to someone but believe me to watch it for 2 hours isnt fun at all Though you laugh several times but its really not enough and it may be more out of despair and disbelieve than out of fun To disturb the boredom director tries to put few movie videoclips into the movie They are really colorful clips of absurd songs maybe from the 50s but its hard to say exactly and they are trying to be funny so hard that its really sad Several times you have a feeling that the plot could evolve into something that a powerful scene is being created but at the end it just somehow evaporates and thats it Beside the clips there are hardly any dialogs let alone music The director is trying to be original and artistic at all cost Personally I cannot recommend the movie I believe that art is something that shouldnt be boring During the projection there was yawning all around the cinema which just corroborates my short review,0
Hope the summary line wont irritate you that much its a little homage to the Chappelle ShowCharlie Murphy but also to the character Daywalker But Ill try to put all the things I liked about the movie in one paragraph and everything I didnt like in another paragraph so it will be easier to read Lets start with the good things The quote strong bloody violence which is used by rating boards to describe the content of a movie does fit here very well This is not a movie for kids Or for the faint of hearted It has Blade as a central character Wesley Snipes is phenomenal and a crazy enough story thread to holdjustify the action scenes The original idea is also very engaging and intelligent The action scenes are great here tooOK over to the things I didnt like The overall story is too thin Its enough as Ive written above to hold the action scenes together but there could be more And a character like Blade deserves more imo The drama therefor isnt the best also its use of clichs doesnt help Some characters are underwritten Thats that o,1
Well the plot is entertaining but it is full of goof To summarize things up copdad badly wants to save his son from cancer but the only way is by getting the transplant from the criminalMichael Keatonwell criminal agrees BUT escaped in the hospital while the transplant was going on and the police and the copdad is not allowed to shoot at the criminal in order to save his son dead criminalno transplantdead sonwell the police in this movie doesnt have a brain in case they never heard of a TAZER to knock off the criminal without killing him end of movie as simple as thatBut it when all crazy and stupid including the death of 2cops and a few doctor getting burned up pretty badly,0
I really dont get all the adulation that this film has received Its mawkish unnecessarily manipulative and dodges many of the big issues ie Nashs affairs and his predilection for having sex with men in public places That I suppose in the context of a commercial Hollywood film is just about tolerable but whats with all the praise for Russell Crowes performance The man just seems to shuffle about clutching his briefcase and wearing a grungy hat and somehow that seems to qualify as fine acting Anyone who has ever known a person with mental health problems will realise that Crowes performance is little short of caricature It is also rather offensive And dare I say just on the right side of being truly terrible,0
This movie was a big disappointment The plot sounded great about a halfhuman halfleopard creature in Africa that becomes the subject of a documentary by young American adults When many of the crew members are found dead the 2 survivors are taken into questioning I wouldnt even call this a horror movie since most of the movie is actually about the misadventures of the aforementioned narcissistic 20somethings which include sex and smoking animal dung to get high isnt as entertaining as it soundstrust me You rarely get to see the creature and the main actor who also happens to be the director screen writer editor and producer is incredibly annoyingI was finally so annoyed by the neverending dialogue that I fastforwarded to the end I had guessed the ending in less than 10 minutes into the movieand I was right Thus this awful movie is utterly predictable tooas if it wasnt bad enough Moral of the story avoid movies that are acted directed edited produced and written by the same nobody And avoid this movie unless held at gunpoint,0
I normally love Jackie Chan movies but this one was terrible There are only 2 or 3 fight scenes all of which are up to normal standard more or less The bad thing about this movie is it focuses a lot on car chasingracing The car chase isnt so bad though not as exciting as fighting but the car racing at the end is exceptionally boring Basically it takes all of things that make a Jackie Chan film a Jackie Chan film and leaves out everything except Jackie Chan Even the traditional outtakes at the end lack their usual humourI suppose to a certain extent it was made worse by the fact I saw one of those horrible dubbed versions I usually try to see the subtitled versionI wish I could understand ChineseIve only seen one Jackie film worse that this one and that was one of his early forays into Hollywood films that didnt turn out so wellAvoid unless really curious or a lover of motor sports,0
The Best Bit When the dull mobster Nicholas Turturro calls out to the runaway Matthew Modine Shane Come Back Shane and when the older wise guy asks him What Are You Doing he replays simply Enjoying My Time Actually like me at the moment The Most Creepy Part Ive been wondering all the time of watching where did I see that girl before where where Till I found out while the closing credits OHH MY GOD Shes Elizabeth Berkley From the showgirls fiasco But I just couldnt recognize her with her clothes on To tell you the truth I felt a brief tremor Shes really cute and nice but maybe Hollywood had no mercy at all The Most Sexy Bit When Berkley says Do You Mean The Stuff Which Gives You A Boner The Most Dull Thing The retarded assistant after a day and a night in the back of the car is still alive and healthy at the end moreover the Mexican smuggler took 3 bullets at the same car and hes not dead either The Most Ugly Thing All of those murdered people as well as the numerous F ward to a boring extent The Most Beautiful Thing The crazy clever script with all the funny characters and the tumultuous situations the acting looked sweet also especially from Paul Rodriguez who stole the show for as he had the best dialogue Also The Most Disappointing Thing Although the direction didnt mess about the storys wittiness at all but in the same time it didnt give it a unique touch a matchless signature some kind of insane hilarity like the one in the story itself However maybe the low production wronged it well And of course the easy tasteless music which could be like that because of cheap production too The Most Confusing Part Matthew Modine is a talented guy but what did he do exactly to be out of Hollywoods A list of stars What could possibly be the thing he made or didnt make to end up in light independent jest like The Shipment The Most Absent Scene Where did Jose the Mexican smuggler go at last I thought that well see him again at the end smuggling once more as the surviving little criminal who in a brief gimmick like this could materialize the continuous disorder of such a world The Most Question I had After The End When well see The Shipment 2 As Im so eager to see that fine small comic hurlyburly atmosphere again These were my own answers If you interested in giving answers of your own for this questionnaire please EMail me,1
Lolita is a rebel and shes going to share to our wide open eyes some little sex stories between scifi and fantasy Well this Surrender Cinema production is not very good very bad acting horrifying music and a story line without any story and any line BUT the sex scenes are pretty well done lot of lesbian scenes and Jacqueline Lovell as beautiful as in The Exotic House Of Wax offer to us a very good final and very hot strip show For Lovells fans only,0
This movie was the slowest and most boring so called horror that I have ever seen I would include a comment on the plot but there was none I do not recommend this movie unless you are prepared for the biggest waste of money and time of your life,0
I saw this when it came out in theaters back in 1996 I remember I was already familiar with Elijah Woods work thats right he made stuff before Lord of the Rings and the merchandising tieins to the film were pretty abundant Flipper water guns were even circulatingAdults were reminded of the old movies and TV show and for nostalgias sake took their kids to see it who were excited because it was a movie about a dolphin and a stupid boyUnfortunately it wasnt what anyone expected and flopped severely You know a movies in trouble when a boy swims away from a Hammerhead shark in the middle of the ocean and a pack of dolphins scare the shark away and the kid instead of getting out of the water into a boat floats in the water for five minutes thanking his dolphin for saving him apparently he hasnt taken into mind that the shark is still out there perhaps even below himAnother problem is Paul Hogan He looks old crusty and tired of recycling his Croc Dundee shtick By now no one even remembered Crocodile Dundee much less Hogan and I half expected him to suddenly start pretending he didnt know what a hair dryer was for the sake of fishoutofwatersocialsatire laughsAll in all this is a really poor family movie that is amateurish and almost hard to watch at times I hated it when I saw it in theaters back in 96 and I hate it more now,0
Ben Stryker an exgreen beret stops off at a little town called Agua Dolee to visit an old friend Tick Rand Soon after riding into town on his Suzuki and settling in A motorcycle gang known as The Savages whos led by tyrant Pigiron invade and finally take over the place Stryker doesnt want to get involved but that changes when he friends become the actual targetsIs there anything good to say about this scuzzy item Tough call as the only fundamental reason to watch this lowbudget car wreck is for the tremendous bcast the crew managed to get hold off for this project While I dont think its a complete botch job its not terribly good either Now what a cast Lance Henriksen being the main character he strangely doesnt have top billing but the final one Karen Black George Kennedy Richard Lynch Bill Forsythe Mickey Jones and Leo Gordon Now what went wrong with this scummy lowbudget bungle The shallowness of the material is too onedimensional that it heavily borrows ideas from better movies namely Mad Max and comes up with a complete mess of ideas that just dont gel and could have been better thought out The clichs that are used can be manipulated into a good viewing despite being predictable but Savage Dawn seems to let it skimpily rush all by without letting the viewer soak it all up The cast are mostly wasted in nothing roles A bleachedblonde Henriksen is capably solid and even with his commending presence that provides an enigmatic glow to his character He doesnt get up to hell of a lot and sometimes goes missing in action Too much sideline action but when he did kick some bikers ass the good times flowed Karen Blacks hissing performance is a very odd one and is all about the screaming and cursing Although she does get into one memorable catfight with Claudia Udys flirtatious vixen character Katie A wheelchair bound George Kennedy roams around aimlessly until the final assault and Richard Lynch looks embarrassed as a wayward priest town mayor in a very redundant role An on edge Bill Forsythe simply chews it up as the head honcho of the notorious biker packThe junky story written by William Milling and Max Bloom has that cheesy comic book getup and very much is influenced by the western genre Just look at the villains for that How they came up with their names is mystery Maybe they drew them out of a hat Its pretty second rate material that more often moves onto one lacklustre scene after another Unfunny comical elements are chucked in and as well a bit of sleaze Tacky exploitation that doesnt get gritty enough and the deaths are quite laughable A clumsy script is filled convoluted details and unbearable trite Simon Nuchterns spotty direction was by the numbers and tepidly laid out One or two intense scenes cant makeup for its tortoiselike pacing and many cackhanded stunts The cardboard sets had down n dirty look but lack that organic sense The gravellike cinematography by Gerald Feil was better handled when the main focus wasnt on the town but on the desolate backdrop like the beginning and ending climax of the film with some neat camera touches Pino Donaggios clunky music choices are drowned out by its own incompetenceSavage Dawn is a forgettable quickie midnight movie thats a definite misfire for most part There are better and more convincing exercises of the same ilk out there,0
I really liked this film All three starsConneryFishburne and Underwood give credible performancesand Harris is enjoyably over the top The lighting and shot angles in some of Harris scenes make his face look truly diabolical The surprising turn of plot at the end makes it interesting Not a great movie but an enjoyable one I gave it 7 of 10,1
CAROLS JOURNEY is a pleasure to watch for so many reasons The acting of Clara Lago is simply amazing for someone so young and she is one of those special actors who can say say much with facial expressions Director Imanol Urbibe presents a tight and controlled film with no break in continuity thereby propelling the plot at a steady pace with just enough suspense to keep one wondering what the nest scene will bring The screenplay of Angel Garcia Roldan is story telling at its best which it seems if the major purpose for films after all The plot is unpredictable yet the events as they unravel are completely logical Perhaps the best feature of this film if to tell a story of the Spanish Civil War as it affected the people It was a major event of the 20th century yet hardly any Americans know of it In fact in 40 years of university teaching I averaged about one student a semester who had even heard of it much less any who could say anything comprehensive about itand the overwhelming number of students were merit scholars all of which speaks to the enormous amount of censorship in American education So in one way this film is a good way to begin a study of that event keeping in mind that when one thread is pulled a great deal of history is unraveled The appreciation of this film is therefore in direct relation to the amount of ones knowledge To view this film as another coming of age movie is the miss the movie completely The Left Elbow Index considers seven aspects of film acting production sets character development plot dialogue film continuity and artistryon a scale for 10 for very good 5 for average and 1 for needs help CAROLS JOURNEY is above average on all counts excepting dialogue which is rated as average The LEI average for this film is 93 raised to a 10 when equated to the IMDb scale I highly recommend this film for all ages,1
The master of movie spectacle Cecil B De Mille goes West Using three legends of the old west as its protagonists they probably never metGary Cooper is portraying Wild Bill HickockJames Ellison as Buffalo Bill and Jean Arthur does make a nice Calamity Jane The story serves only for De Mille to hang some marvelous action sequences on like the big Indian attackScenes like that are extremely well doneIf you dont mind the somewhat overthetop performances of the cast this is an very entertaining westernLook out for a very young Anthony Quinn essaying the role of an Indian brave who participated at the battle of Little Big HornThis part got him at least noticed in Hollywood,1
When I learned of Sir Alec Guinness death this was the first of his many films I thought of reseeing What a wonderful droll commentary the film provides even after all these years And Guinness helps to weave the charm into every frame His eyes and face are as luminous as that white suit he wears Both he and the film have to be considered lifetime favorites,1
When I was six yo I learned about a series called Los Campeones and even if I was just a kid I did everything I need to convince my parents to let me watch The Champions and the Avengers once every week I think that was the Golden Age of English series I already own the complete cycle of The Prisoner but lasted also a few years later with The Tomorrow People the Worst Witch I just me or this is Harry Potter in girl of course before As much as I want The Campions to be in Zone 1 or Zone 4 Im also waiting for Dr Who pack the whole series in a set of uhm maybe 300 DVDs please I couldnt expend more for it 8 People of Tomorrow and several other low budget but great stories to be available within my reached zones I speak and understand English but not all my relatives do including my parents whom introduced me into these great stories I hope someday someone could feel the attraction of these series and then could sell them as I originally view them Dubbed or subtitled but in the same format I saw them Remember Zone 1 or 4 are OK with my TV set,1
I first rented this movie on the infamous day of September 11 2001 Since then Ive seen it a number of times My only complaint is that its too short Strangeland wouldve be a complete piece of horror art at two hours As it stands the running time is only an hour and a halfExTwisted Sister member Dee Snider wrote produced and stars in this 1998 shockfest set in a small Colorado town He plays Carleton Hendricks a crazed sadist who has psychotic ideologies on human evolution and a love for neardeath experiences Hendricks is no pushover hes a pumped up sixfoot modern primitive Someone who has tattooed and pierced their body to the very extreme When he makes his first full appearance in the film it is a truly terrifying sightHendricks main hobby in life is to share his spiritual awakenings with his kidnapped victims He visits Internet chatrooms under the name Capt Howdy and then invites people over to his house They believe theyre going to a party Instead they find themselves in a house of pain and suffering Hendricks sows their eyes and mouths shut and tortures them by sticking blades and hooks in numerous parts of their body If it sounds sick its because it isOne of Hendricks victims is Genevieve the teenaged daughter of detective Michael Gage Gage not only manages to save her but arrests Hendricks as well Four years later Hendricks is released from a mental institution completely rehabilitated to the disapproval of the community A group of rednecks led by Freddy Krueger himself actor Robert Englund decide to kill him They fail and Hendricks reverts back to his old selfThe rest of the film Ill leave to you only to say the conclusion is satisfying and will leave you in shivers With the exception of Snider the acting isnt too good but its serviceable The direction is okay too There are some humorous parts in Strangeland and they are very funny I also loved the soundtrack its awesome and worth buying if you love rock Overall this is a movie worth watching If you love lowbudget horror films with a sense of humor check it out Youll probably like it,0

Well I read the other comments Didnt think it sounded any good but decided to tape it anyway Perhaps not so smart to read all the poor reviews before watching this movie because of course I would be noticing all the same weird things Excessive use of fade to black a few weird camera angles and crosscutting dialog for different conversations with the same people taking place at different times But noticing all that I thought to myself Well this would probably be really boring if it was all going chronologically The conversations arent that exciting but kind of mandatory And the constant fading to black after really short scenes really makes it feel like the story is fast forwarding too the interesting part Skipping the boring bits At the end of the movie it gets a bit exciting too Will they survive So I actually liked this movie No not really The director had some interesting ideas on how to keep the audience from being bored while he is trying to introduce the characters But he is overdoing it It gets annoying and sometimes confusing This was apparently only the second movie he directed so maybe he will learn and make really good stuff in the future And if youre sitting there in the future reading this wondering if the now famous directors second movie is worth a watch Well if he is good in the future sure watch this crap and wonder how he ever got to make a third one Otherwise this movie isnt really worth watching unless you very interested in filmmaking and want to see one way you can cut the mandatory boring introductory scenes into something watchable,0
When HULK hit theaters in 2003 it wasnt long before DVDs of the old Incredible Hulk TV show popped up in an attempt to cash in on the craze We saw a similar occurrence a year prior when SpiderMan cartoons appeared on DVD to coincide with that heros big screen debut Companies leap at the opportunity to ride on the financial coattails of a hot brandSo the fact that this picture never surfaced on the shelves of WalMart as its featured heroes clobbered the box office in the summer of 2005 says a lot I guess everyone involved would just rather forget To be fair THE FANTASTIC FOUR is not as bad as everyone says Let me rephrase that Its not as unentertaining as all of its negative reviews might suggestVeteran television actor Alex HydeWhite no you dont remember any of his roles leads the way as Reed Richards the brilliant scientist who along with his crew gains bizarre powers after an outer space mishap Hes left with the ability to stretch and contort his body to outrageous lengths His future wife Sue Storm Rebecca Staab can suddenly turn invisible while her brother Johnny Jay Underwood may now ignite himself at will Then theres poor Ben Grimm Michael Bailey Smith the lovable lug whose body morphs into a mass of craggy orange rockJust as the friends are becoming accustomed to all of this they are called upon to rescue the world from certain chaos It seems Reeds old colleague Victor von Doom Joseph Culp is living up to his name and that villainous Jeweler Ian Trigger isnt exactly helping old ladies cross the street either Can our heroes save the day Of course they can like any superhero movie its just a question of how and whenWhats striking about THE FANTASTIC FOUR is how amateurish it is in virtually every aspect The dialog is so lame and tired it sounds like it was written by a junior high drama class The acting is so unpolished it makes a thirdrate afternoon soap opera look like Shakespeare The special effects are surprisingly good considering the minuscule budget but there are still some positively embarrassing moments When The Human Torch fully ignites his body for instance the entire movie briefly turns into a cartoon I can just hear that production meeting Oh no one will notice Theyll be too intrigued by the action I mean really a cartoon At least give me a mannequin on fire held up by a string Prior to that the scene in which the foursome come to on earth after their spaceship crashes is pure teensinthebackyard fare The crew simply found a field and lit a vaguelyspaceshiplike object on fire Thats the only remnant of such a major disasterOf course there wasnt a whole lot to work with in the script There is a fairly coherent story here but its all so simplified When Reed and Ben decide to go into outer space they simply drop by the Storms house and ask if theyd care to join them Is it really that easy Dont these sort of things require oh I dont know years of training and expertise Not in the world of these writers who seemed to be inspired by the underrated genius on display in FULL HOUSE reruns But as bad as that may be nothing can compare to how painfully clichd Dr Doom is He was pulled right out of those awful superhero cartoons from the 1960s right down to the evil laugh and slamming his clenched fist down on the table to punctuate his remarks No comic book least of all Fantastic Four has ever featured a villain so obscenely one dimensionalUltimately THE FANTASTIC FOUR is saved from being a complete turkey because its just so damn innocent You can tell the people involved as little talent or experience as they had really tried They didnt know the final result would be so embarrassing They were under the impression that this was their big break that people would flock to the theaters It bears repeating that they had virtually no money to work with and Im sure half of that was eaten up by the cool Thing costume All things considered they did well and for its many flaws the finished product is a fair amount of fun for comic book fans,0
I had the greatest enthusiasm going in to the advance screening for this movie After all this is one of the oldest and most complex tales known to mankind and it was one of the first epic tales I read as a kid even before Tolkien I must say that IT WAS A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT They completely made the plot into a joke and turned the thing into one long soap opera The elements that WERE faithful to the plot were sprinkled throughout in such a haphazard manner that the audience was laughing at many times at the silly script that just paid lip service to this battle of all battles It was a huge disappointment to see a complex character like Achilles who has a strange combination of nearly Matrixlike powers utter ruthlessness and male lovers in the original poem turn to Fabio on the beach in the guise of Pitt who with a good script and more effort could have turned this into the most complex and original warrior figure Hollywood has ever produced The actors were actually decent trying to make the best of a ridiculous script It was actually a waste of so much talent Peter OToole stole the show and Orlando Bloom and Sean Bean were pathetic Compare it to LOTR or Gladiator and it doesnt even hold a candle to them Plenty of hunks for the ladies to goggle over but not enough battle scenes for a movie that is about one long battle and siege I wouldnt recommend that anyone pay to see this story dragged through the dirt like one of the characters was at least they got that part right,0
I absolutely positively loved the movie I just saw it and cant wait for it to come out on DVD It is a beautifully welldrawn masterpiece I am always amazed with the intricately drawn work of Ghibli studios Others have commented on Sosuke calling Risa by her first name He never calls his Father by his first name unless he is speaking about him to someone else I didnt get the impression that Risa was his mother It was never even mentioned or implied by anyone It is quite obvious that she is his stepmother That is why he makes her promise to come home and why he gets so upset when he finds her empty car His mother must have died when he was an infant because he mentions being nursed by Risa This coupled with his father being out to sea a lot is why he has abandonment issues Everyone also talks about how mature he is This usually occurs when a child loses a parent,1
This season lacked real oomf but as far as setting up stories to get us in the mood again season 6 is without highlights and spontaneityThis season lacked its usual Sopranos style and if you cut out all the garbage that was filled in each and every episode this season you probably would have had 6 episodes worth of real storiesSide stories like Paulys mom is she or isnt she was boring and had no purpose other than further exploration of his character I would have like to have seen Bobby express his anger more at Pauly in that carnival episode but to no availAnd thats just it These side stories had no real purpose and lack finishing If they are going to finish off these stories in the next 6 episodes Id rather not watch it because its not really worth seeingDisappointing is to nice a word to say about this season and its finale,0

SPOILERS Whatever else can or cant be said about it SURFACE is superbly crafted The cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart Conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND by way of CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON with a bit of JAWS and GODZILLA thrown in for good measure say And there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here This series SURFACEd seemingly from out of nowhere and by sheer dint of its straightforward storytelling carried the viewer along for the better part of an entire season All things considered a job very well done I only hope it reSURFACEs next season,1
Prof Janos Rukh Boris Karloff discovers Radium Xa powerful force to be used for atomic power Unfortunately Rukh has been contaminated by the Radium and starts to glow in the darkand his touch causes instant death Dr Felix Benet Bela Lugosi develops an antidotebut Rukh starts to go mad due to the Radium AND the antidote and sets out to kill all he believed wronged himThe plot is silly and the effects that make Karloff glow in the dark are laughable but this is still a fun little chiller It moves quickly has some great atmosphere notice Rukhs house and the movie starts on a dark and rainy night and Karloff and Lugosi as always give great performances There is also good acting by Franic Drake as Rukhs wife and Violet Kemble Cooper as his mother So its OK but just a notch below all the other KarloffLugosi movies The plot is just too farfetched for me to swallow Still I did like this I give it a 7,1
This movie is so good I first seen it when i was six then i bought it recently and i still love it im 15 now Plus the acting was great and Madonna is my idol and she did a phat job Alot of people didnt like this movie and i still to this day dont understand why,1
Someone must have been seriously joking when they made this filmFirstly it is an absolute impossibility that this movie was made in 1993 The fashions and music dictate that this is seriously 80s My guess is that this has sat on the shelf for a long while before some crazed distributer picked it up and released it to a disbelieving worldThere is a plot Kind of A strange loner meets a random man with a beard who tells him that if he meditates while singing his favourite song he will be able to turn into whomever he chooses At this point I feel obliged to point out that the loners favourite song is London Bridge Is Falling Down Why is this his favourite song Because hes an idiot We are only a minute into the film and already the film has reached a monumental level of stupidity It gets even stupiderThe loner is the nostril picker I can only assume this as there are two scenes in the film where he is seen picking his nose That clears up the title He decides to change into a girl so that he can get close to other girls And kill them Thats more or less itThe acting is universally appalling Every single performance in this movie sucks In fact I would go so far as to say that the acting is of the standard of a pornographic movie It really is that terrible The nostril picker appears to the audience as the nostril picker The characters in the movie see him as the girl he has become through singing London Bridge Is Falling Down Man I feel like an idiot even typing this Anyway it is kind of strange seeing a middle aged weirdo hanging out with school girls And not in a good way There is even an extended montage of scenes where the nostril picker is at school with the girls and a song plays over the top It is very possibly the worst song ever recorded Im not even going to describe it Youll know it when you hear it And youll agree with meThere are some scenes of violence sure And there is a Benny Hill style chase sequence involving a transsexual There is even an immortal bit of dialogue that may or may not have been taken from Shakespeare or John Milton where the nostril picker says to a prostitute Ive got the cash if youve got the gash Lovely Im sure youll agreeUtter nonsense,0
This movie is so wonderful its hard to find words to describe it This is the only time I cant decide which was better the book or the movieWhoopi Goldberg is awesome and Oprah Winfrey such a good actress she could be funny happy and miserable all at the same time All together the movie was well directed by Steven Speilberg and should not be passed up 910,1
I thought it was weird and just gory not scary I have seen a couple of the Japanese horror films Ringu and Juon and loved them but this movie was a disappointment It never even explained anything about the curse I just didnt see any horror it wasnt scary to me at all The whole time I was watching I was waiting for Kirie to discover the secret of the curse and why it was happening now If this was some ancient curse why didnt it happen before Shuichis father And it never told us what happened to her father I kept waiting for someone to tell us the meaning or the reasoning behind this curse and then it just ended I was very disappointed,0
I guess only a selected number of audience members really had any interest in watching how a male hustler in New York operates but Id be willing to bet that even these brave souls were turned off by the irritating patchwork technique and deliberately muffled sound recording on display here the fact that these inherent defects were a direct result of the films lowbudgetundergroundexperimental nature is Id say beside the point Anyway for those so inclined the film features extensive male nudity and Joe Dallesandro understandably became an underground and gay icon The episodic structure showing the daytoday routine of the hustler protagonist offers a couple of mildly interesting scenes his meeting with and eventually posing for an eccentric elderly artist the one where Dallesandro expresses his views on his unusual line of work and delineates his particular modus operandi to a couple of prospective colleagues including perhaps the unlikeliest of hustlers a bespectacled nerd Perhaps mercifully the film ran for only 89 minutes against the IMDbs claim that its complete length is 105 but the latter could well be a mistake I had watched a few other of Warhols movies and this one is decidedly not as satisfying as the most tolerable example Ive run into yet BAD 1977 and only slightly better than the likes of MY HUSTLER 1965 which were mostly a strain to sit through The fact that this was only the first part of a trilogy did not augur well but as the saying goes you gotta to do what you gotta do and the other two chapters had to follow in quick succession Despite my generally negative reaction to it FLESH is nevertheless still valuable as a 1960s time capsule and as a prototype of the Underground scene of that era both cinematically and in real life For the record an image of Dallesandro from this film adorns the sleeve of The Smiths selftitled 1984 debut album and transsexual Candy Darling who appears here rather unremarkably was immortalized in Candy Says the opening track of The Velvet Undergrounds eponymous 1969 album Although the latter band is my alltime favorite and one of the reasons for this is that through their sheerly unique and groundbreaking music they described a lifestyle so utterly different from my own this is truly a case where Id much rather experience something aurally instead of visually,0
Lucio Fulcis Cat in the Brain is an inventive and somewhat egotistical tale of a directors decent into madness The director in question is Fulci himself who stars in the film Fulci has become known to horror fans everywhere as the godfather of gore and for good reason as he has provided us with some of the nastiest and most gruesome films ever to grace the silver screen from the eyeball violence in films like Zombi 2 to a man been hacked to death with chains in The Beyond all the way to the full on gore fest known as The New York Ripper if you want gore and lets face it who doesnt Fulci is your man However all this catering for gorehounds like you and I has taken its toll on Fulcis mental state and hes quickly delving into madness brought about by what he films Fulcis problems dont end at his mental state either as his psychiatrist that he has gone to see about his problem has took it upon himself to take up murder as a hobby using Fulcis films as blueprints for the murdersIve got to say the acting in this film is absolutely atrocious There is one scene in particular that involves a hooker and its only fit to be laughed at for both its acting and its stupidity Fulci takes the lead role of the film obviously Hes not an actor and it shows but his performance is actually the best in the film Its even safe to say that one the whole the acting is bad for an Italian horror film Of course nobody goes into an Italian horror expecting good acting so its somewhat forgivable but I do think that Fulci could have hired some better ones Bad dubbing doesnt exactly help either However something that does help is the fact that the terrible acting is counterbalanced by lots of gore and its extreme to say the least People get their heads cut off a woman is slain in the shower and unlike Psycho here we REALLY see it people are hacked up fed to pigs and theres lots and lots of cinemas finest melee weapon the chainsaw on display which delighted me no end The amount of gore is massively over the top a lot of the time which gives the film something of a spoof feel but Cat in the Brain is obviously a tongue in cheek film anywayIt would be hard to make a film about yourself and not come across as being a bit of a big head and Fulci does indeed come across as a bit of a big head in this movie His name is mentioned often and hes on screen nearly all the time its not too much unlike New Nightmare in the ego stakes but its obvious he had a good time making this and I for one had fun watching it so we can forgive him a little egotism The films ending lets it down I saw it coming a mile off but then didnt seriously think that the movie would take that route but I was wrong it did unfortunately The ending left me cold and the film is a better watch if you turn it off just before the final two minutes However despite its ending and terrible acting Cat in the Brain is a lot of fun and will please Fulci enthusiasts no end and it is therefore recommended,1
It ran 8 seasons but its first in early 1959 and its last in the autumn of 1965 were shorter than seasons 27 CBS chief William Paley canceled Rawhides production after watching the 1st show of season 8 in September 1965 because he disliked the series without Eric Fleming as Gil Favor who had departed after season 7 The last new episode aired in November 1965 The lone 1966 CBS broadcast on January 4 1966 was a rerun I have often wondered why Rawhide didnt switch to color filming for its last season Most of the big westerns of the 1960s had gone over to color by 1965 CBS was broadcasting in color that autumn for many of their sitcoms but westerns like Gunsmoke and Rawhide remained in black and white Gunsmoke was the last western and last prime time network series to switch to color on September 17 1966 for the episode Snap Decision,1
I am not a big fan of Rajnikant in the first place but Baba was a huge disappointment In between an awful storyline the action and songs were only mediocre The storyline becomes very preachy Instead of running for office like NTR or MGR Rajni almost appeared to be running as Tamil Nadus next big guru My wife tells me that since this film came out Rajni swore off doing any more moviesWe were lucky initially to have bought Babu an oldie by Sivajiganeshan online by accident when trying to buy this onethat was a great film which made up for having bought this dudexcept it makes Baba look even worse by comparisonBryan,0
Junior high and high school teachers will find The Cure an excellent teaching tool both as a companion to Huckleberry Finn or as a standalone lesson Although AIDS is supposed to be the main theme the strong suptext of friendship and love as they evolve between Eric and Dexter is a powerful message for teenagers Writing prompts centered around the symbolism of the tennis shoe are particularly effective I also suggest directed class discussion about how Eric evolves from manipulative user to loving friend,1
The first part Che in Cuba is about that portion of his life It contains too many indistinguishable battles and Che ministering to too many indistinguishable wounded remember that Che was a physician It ends as Castro wins the revolution Che never gets to Havana The second part Che in Bolivia is about guess what It contains too many indistinguishable battles and Che ministering to too many indistinguishable woundedWhen I realized this was supposed to be an epic I never knew anything but the title before it started I naturally thought of the greatest epic of them all David Leans Lawrence of Arabia More of that laterNot to be a racist but aside from what Ive already mentioned is the fact that there are too many characters who are well indistinguishable unknown Hispanic actors who look alike especially considering they all wear Che beards and all wear Che fatigues This results in the viewer not being able to identify with anyone other than Che Benicio del Toro even Fidel has a very minor role While del Toros terrific think of Lawrence with Peter OToole as the only discernible character no Alec Guinness no Omar Sharif no Anthony Quinn etc You get the ideaBecause the other characters are interchangeable this results in a loss of reference When top aides of Che are killed you feel no remorse since you dont know who they are Even when Che is killed I dont think thats a spoiler theres no empathy from the audience hes just killedHes too onedimensional to relate to as a human being Aside from being a revolutionary and second only to Jesus in moral rectitude the only thing we learn about Che is that hes married with five children he tells another character that near the end What was his motivation A complete enigmaMaybe Soderbergh is purposely aping Lean Like Soderberghs Che Lean never lets us know anything about Lawrence the mystery man of Arabia But at least Lawrence had a friend Sharif and associates Guinness Quinn He was as courageous as he was insecure ie had human qualities Che is like a machine about as warm as The TerminatorEarlier this year there was another war epic Mongol Che makes Mongol look like Its a Wonderful Life,0

The movie opens up with a long single shot of aisles in factory crammed with workers My what weve done to the planet you might think I hope we get to see other things like thisThats very rare When youre not looking at a horribly filmed angle of the narrator at a lecture hall youre watching him set up his camera to take pictures in different locations Itd be nice if chose areas that were more fitting with his topic but he doesnt So then youll hear some more narration watch a few pictures go by and watch him set up his camera Why not use the filming camera to show more of the landscapes instead It really kills any sense of pacing and paints the guy as more of vain jerkI could read tips on how someone set up their camera fast forward through this whole movie and waste a lot less time,0
This period melodrama is one of Griffiths earliest claustrophobic films Characters trapped within a room are prevalent throughout his work and as time went by he would become increasingly adept at portraying their helplessness and involving the audience in their terror In the bluntly titled Sealed Room there is one major difference to the normal plot line in that there truly is no escapeGriffith achieves the claustrophobic effect here in two ways First is his use of space While the typical Biograph short might utilise a dozen or more sets The Sealed Room features only two adjoining rooms the kings court and the dove cote that becomes the eponymous tomb The set design in these shorts is rarely referenced but here it is crucial The court is a large interior with a backdrop hinting at greater depth and showing us a window and a staircase Actors enter and leave from various directions suggesting the room is not only spacious but also free and open By contrast the dove cotes back wall is very close to the camera and the angles in it suggesting a hexagonal or octagonal shape make it seem even more confinedThe second technique on display here is the crosscutting Anyone with an interest in Griffiths work will probably know about his heavy use and development of crosscutting to build excitement or tension Many will also know that strictly speaking it wasnt his invention However what makes Griffiths crosscuts so effective is the way he paces the opposing images so they complement each other The Sealed Room contains a good example of what I mean The shots of the masons shifting the heavy bricks have a slow stepbystep pace to them with tension building as the wall gets higher This movement is matched by the shots of the blissfully unaware lovers in which Marion Leonard tears off flower petals onebyone As the couple realise their predicament their rising panic is complemented by the opposing shot of the king madly thrashing his sword against the wallAt this point Griffith was yet to realise that the action could be heightened further by introducing a third strand to the crosscut The dramatic ridetotherescue here absent was later to become a standard climax to Griffiths pictures,1
I finished watching Mandy Lane about an hour ago and felt the urge to come straight home and get up here to warn anyone thats about to spend money on the DVD DONTThe supporting characters are shallow the failure of acting is higher than that of Matthew McConaughey movies and up until the end twist the plot is everything but obvious In nine out of ten you can see the next scene coming 5 minutes before it starts The whole movie is more or less without motive or message and the halfway revealing of the murderer just plain out kills what little interest you might have left at that point What could have saved this shallow tedious movie is some decent splatter or at least gore worthy of the genre Slasher It fails there as wellIf you need a background movie to a party that you can jump in and out of without missing anything I recommend buying All The Boys Love Mandy LaneIf youre looking to sit down and actually concentrate your eyes on the screen for more than 15 seconds I dont,0
Riding high on the success of Rebel Without a Cause came a tidal wave of teen movies Arguably this is one of the best A very young McArthur excels here as the not really too troubled teen The story concentrates more on perceptions of delinquency than any traumatic occurrence The supporting cast is memorable Frankenheimer directs like an old pro Just a story of a young man that finds others take his actions much too seriously,1
I saw this because my cousin is an extra in one of the wedding scenes I read somewhere that Oz and Rudnick wanted to poke fun at liberal message movies but the climax ends up being right out of one of those movies Also some of the humor is a bit on the cloying side Joan Cusack was too overthetop for me and someone has a strange timeline re the Oscars Still there were more than enough funny moments like the kiss scene the wedding that isnt and the scene with the principal to enjoy this Kline as always is good but for me the real surprise was Selleck whom Im not a big fan of but pokes fun at himself nicely here,1
This short was director Del Lords last and only Shemp short The problem It was quite weak and the cafe scene was pretty much a carbon copy of a Curly short Busy Buddies 1944 The interrogation scene was pretty funny and the beginning part of the cafe part But there are a lot of plotholes in this short For example why are the stooges hiding in the garbage can when the police come In the remake Of Cash And Hash1955 director Jules White fixes this and the reason for the stooges hiding in the garbage can is because there is a gunfight between the police and the armored car robbers The scene in which Moe is having trouble with the oyster was done before with Curly in Dutiful But Dumb 1941 The spooky house part wasnt all that great except for the hilarious scene on the outside of the spooky house To top it off the ending had no sting to it Rating C,0
From start to finish this 1926 classic two reeler from the Hal Roach Studios seems to sum up what was fun about the 20s It stars the now forgotten comic genius Charley Chase and was directed by the legendary Leo McCarey who was unknown then but would earn his keep with Roach and graduate to greener pastures in the 30s and 40s Recently released onto video and disc this is one of the ten best examples of silent screen comedy and should be seen by audiences of all ages Although today his star has virtually diminished Charley Chase was considered the leader in the short subject comedy field in the waning years of the silents He helped the careers of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy before they were brought together as a team Leo McCarey and a host of other talents It is a shame that he is all but remembered today Check out this little gem of a film Once you do you will be seeking out other films from this classic comic He had his hand in over 300 films and many of them survive Rediscover this lost giant of a film from a bygone era and its giant star,1
The premise of Cabin Fever starts like it MIGHT have something to offer A group of college teens after finals in the fall goes to a resort cabin in the woods where one by one they are attacked by an unseen flesh eating virusUnfortunately the first paragraph is where any remote elements of film quality stop Cabin Fever is little more than college kids looking for sex booze talking nonstop about nothing and seeing how many Fbombs they can get into 140 minutes or however long this mess isThe kids act and react stupidly to everything around them One of them for instance discovers that the skin virus has infected her legs so what does she do She keeps shaving her legs failing to take proper medical attention for her wounds The scene is little more than a gross out In another scene Rider Strong from Boy Meets World gets bitten on the hand by some kid who only says Pancakes and likes to do karate kicks on those who sit next to him If you can figure out the reason for why the Pancakes kid was included Id love to know Anyway Rider pets a wild dog and goes off to wash his bitten hand in a most likely contaminated creek Another kid likes to drop Fbombs in reacting to everything around him and shoot squirrels Why Your guess is as good as mineRider Strong is the ONLY kid with any recognition in this movie He tries to calm people down inbetween the yelling and screaming and F Y bombs that people are throwing around When the kids arent yelling they are having or talking about sex or talking nonsense to the other adult characters who are EVEN MORE if that is possibleidiotic than the kids The idiot cop with an IQ of 60 at best may be one of the WORST acting jobs I have ever seen in a movie You talk about people not playing with a full deck this dork doesnt even know how to find the cards LOL I was like Will you PLEASE shut up already He makes the kid actors look like geniuses The only part that I sort of liked was Riders scary story although gory about the deranged bowling alley guy In interviews Rider said that he had a great deal of respect for director Eli Roth But the problem is that Mr Roth appears to be going for little more than shock and gore There are far too many bad things about this movie for Mr Roth to get any credit I wish I could agree with Rider and find something likable about this movie Maybe the fall scenery in the beginning Actually Rider Strong JUST saves this movie from being a 1 Hopefully he was compensated for this junk,0

And yet another run of South Park comes to an end This wasnt as strong an episode as Id hoped for but Night of the Living Homeless was a stronger finisher then Stanleys Cup Tsst Bloody Mary or Erection Day It still cant hold a candle to Woodland Critter Christmas and Goobacks but few episodes canNight of the Living Homeless is a spoof of the zombie genre done in a way only South Park would think of Instead of flesh eating zombies the entities are homeless that request change and seem to survive off of itRandy and other residents are locked in the Community Center though this time on the roof where they can survey the scene A particularly funny moment is when one member finds out his home is gone and becomes homeless leaving Randy no choice but to shoot himMeanwhile the four boys set out to solve the problem with the whole story behind the homeless takeover trying to convey a message but being seriously uninspired South Park is at its best a lot of the times when it is being ridiculous Matt and Trey played it safe this week and didnt really critique the homeless problem just lampooned itThe shock moment of the episode comes when a scientist shoots himself in an attempt to avoid the homeless This is the first time a suicide on South Park goes wrong and we watch the poor man miss his brain and then attempt to shoot himself many times while he painfully dies Another inspired South Park momentOverall the episode was funny but it was kept from being great by withholding any real commentary on the homeless and sticking straight with the zombie shtick The ending is somewhat funny but nothing newNow we must wait until October for the next batch of episodes Its a long haul but South Park must be applauded for its run The show seemed to be running out of steam last season but now its back in full form,1
Oh Gawd I want to time travel back to Monogram Studios and throttle someone in their 2 room front office for this sloppy musical It is one watt above flatlining for 60 of its 61 minutes and then actually shows for the one thin minute spread in millisecond blips across the hour that there is real life talent being badly photographedI just dont see the point of going to some trouble to actually make this film that could easily be energetic and actually funny and allow lethargy to be the main thing on view The weird storyline shows cranky vaudeville trouper Grace Hayes bulldozing her blowsy way into a college where her ratbag son is rich college clown Shes gonna fix his playboy ways no matter whatHer real life son weird looking Peter Hays plays her screen son His real life wife plays her secretary Talk about nepotism I suspect this talent package was almost the raison detre for Monogram financing this backlot musical produced by resident schlockmeister extraordinaire Sam Katzman As with other Monogram musicals it just looks more like a reason to film recent new furniture purchases and light fittings in order to show off to other studios that Monogram Pictures are lavish in their B grade ways Have a ghastly look at SWING PARADE OF 1946 for genuine evidence of this they just constructed this gigantic nightclub set then found an excuse to film actors and musicians running all over it Story None Anyway ZIS BOOM BAH is more BAH than BOOM Where was Gale Storm and Mantan Mooreland when Monogram really needed them Probably standing at the boom gate of PRC Pictures wondering if it looked safe to enter there Junior jive hepster Roland Dupree springs to life to rappety tap his teen legs around two wobbly dance numbers especially in the big show finale set in the new and expanded malt shoppeclub set The usual crumpled curtains are loosely hanging on the back wall and the stage set of mis matched drapery even has one dark main rag that is yanked back and forth as each amateur sequence elbows past the previous one The chorus girls and their very plain looking partners in this finale just look like Monogram office staff borrowed from typing and carpentry for the morning of filming They have absolutely no dance talent and are so ordinary on screen ALL the girls look like they are all called Joyce There is even a costume calamity where they wear frilly hotpantson one leg only It is all so awful and crummyand actually annoying when one more tweak up by all concerned would result in ZIS being actually FUN The one strangely interesting thing is the dialog delivery between Grace and her sondaughter in law it is so casually delivered that it actually works in spite of the script and logic She has a very life like presence which is the only thing that allows the ridiculous story to be slightly compelling The Dupree kid is the real star He can actually do somethingin spite of looking like a tubby Liberace tap dancing teen You read that right,0
This is an excellent little known movie Tom Selleck does an outstanding job of acting in this movie with the Japanese Clint Eastwood Id love to see if this movie has come out on DVD yet there are some spots that clearly have been cut Hiroku Toms love interest has clearly had some parts chopped It would be interesting to see more of Japan in the film The baseball sequences are far and away the most realistic of any baseball movie Im quite sure most of the actors were current or former baseball players I love loading the tape of this movie at least once a year Best scenes involve the lack of hat tipping after Tom gets beaned in the big game and an intensely sensual scene of Tom having a hot bath with Hiroku Dennis Haysbert also does a great job its good to see hes finally getting some recognition not just in baseball movieshe was also in Major League,1
I loved the movie I loved Timothy Dalton and Joanne Whaley The movie had many different locations in it I really liked when Ann Hampton realized she could not make Rhett love her And when Scarlett and Ann where together and Ann apologizes for taking Rhett and Scarlett just told her not to worry she would get him back It had a great story it told You just can not compare it to GWTW It just has so many great scenes I love both SCARLETT AND GWTW Of course do not forget to have a hankie handy,1
The trailers for this film were better than the movie What waste of talent and money Wish I wouldve waited for this movie to come on DVD because at least I wouldnt be out 9 The movie totally misses the mark What could have been a GREAT movie for all actors turned out to be a Bmovie at best Movie moved VERY slow and just when I thought it was going somewhere it almost did but then it didnt In this day and age we need unpredictable plot twists and closures in film and this film offered neither The whole thing about how everyone is a suspect is good however not sure if it was the way it was directed the lighting the delivery of lines the writing or what but nothing came from it Lot of hype for nothing I was VERY disappointed in this film and Im telling everyone NOT to see it The cheesy saxophone music throughout made the film worse as well And the ending had NOTHING to do with the rest of the film What a disappointment,0
I know its a movie But when it comes to portray real life in any matter it should be as faithful as possible Im sorry but El Misterio Galndez isnt as accurate as it seems Nor is the Dominican Republic depicted as it really is In fact it shocked me to see that the filming location for Santo Domingo was actually Cuba And incredibly enough movies with Cuban themes Havana The lost City Bitter Sugar The Godfather part II were actually filmed in Santo Domingo So what happened here Why did they shoot the movie in Cuba instead of the DR The Spanish dialogs with the Cuban accent are horrible Those are not Dominicans On the historic level Galndez would have never been hanged He might as well been shot decapitated or died from the inhumane torture hed been receiving Then thrown his body in the Caribbean sea But Trujillo would have never ordered death by strangulation His sick mind wouldnt have allowed itActing isnt delivered as expected Harvey Keitel looks like hes just expecting a paycheck I prefer the leading actress in Deep Blue Sea The rest of the cast would have been excellent in some Cuban movie and the same goes for the selected shooting locationI suggest La fiesta del chivo The feast of the goat from bestselling author Mario Vargas Llosa directed by his cousin Luis Llosa Its a bit more realistic with Dominican history The Trujillo character is very well portrayed and the Galindez incident is treated very briefly in this movie,0
It is terrible It is like somebody gave a kid a faulty video camera and 30 and told them to make a film Even then youd get a better and more professional film than this The story is so dumb you can say there isnt one I dont think the guy who made this knew what to do at all watching foreign art movies all day long isnt enough to make somebody an instant director The acting is very bad really kindergarten level and the writing is just plain awful The only scene I didnt hate was the one with the caravan accident but even that only means it was just slightly less horrible than the rest of the film How do people get finance for this stuff I dont mind alternative films but shouldnt they at least not be a big steaming pile of cow manure I would call Price of Milk amateurish if it wasnt an insult to amateurs This would not even be a good film if you were drunk or drugged,0
Anyone whos watched a few Lifetime Movie Network movies knows that plot credibility is the first thing that gets brushed off the planning table So when crazed Lara moves into Pattis home and methodically begins to drive her landlady bonkers I didnt even blink When Lara eventually ramps up her activities to threatening poor Patti and dares her to do anything about it I just nodded You see on Planet LMN people dont behave the way they do for any particular reason they just do it to keep the action going Only on Planet LMN could someone almost have the owner of a home thrown out of their own house by means of their seductive powers Poor Patti she just trusted too much and Lara went off her medicine and then there was this big fight at the top of the stairs involving a syringe full of deadly stuff that ends up injected into someones tummy and a body bag going out the front door The horrorBut take it from me this Planet LMN product is a classic You need to watch it once just for the great laughs youll have On the Improbability Scale I give this film a 95100 Make a big batch of popcorn and get some apple slices too Youll understand later,0
Well Cube 1997 Vincenzos first movie was one of the most interesting and tricky ideas that Ive ever seen when talking about movies They had just one scenery a bunch of actors and a plot So what made it so special were all the effective direction great dialogs and a bizarre condition that characters had to deal like rats in a labyrinth His second movie Cypher 2002 was all about its story but it wasnt so good as Cube but here are the characters being tested like rats againNothing is something very interesting and gets Vincenzo coming back to his Cube days locking the characters once again in a very different space with no time once more playing with the characters like playing with rats in an experience room But instead of a thriller scifi even some of the promotional teasers and trailers erroneous seemed like that Nothing is a loose and light comedy that for sure can be called a modern satire about our society and also about the intolerant world were living Once again Vicenzo amaze us with a great idea into a so small kind of thing 2 actors and a blinding white scenario thats all you got most part of time and you dont need more than that While Cube is a claustrophobic experience and Cypher confusing Nothing is completely the opposite but at the same time also desperateThis movie proves once again that a smart idea means much more than just a millionaire budget Of course that the movie fails sometimes but its prime idea means a lot and offsets any flaws Theres nothing more to be said about this movie because everything is a brilliant surprise and a totally different experience that I had in movies since Cube,1
I think that this film has become an important record of the most horrifying aspect of the East German regime the imprisonment of its people by what the regime called its antifascist protective wall It is a document of desperation and courage not to be missed I would however like to comment on the actual location of this escape It did not happen in or around Berlin as supposed by some respondents and was nothing to do directly with the Berlin Wall The escape balloon was flown over the Iron Curtain which not only divided Germany but it divided the whole of Europe at that time The balloon took off from Pssneck 170 miles southwest of Berlin in the German Democratic Republic East Germany and flew 14 miles to Naila in Bavaria and freedom in West Germany The opening of the Iron Curtain in Hungary in 1989 preceded the fall of the Berlin Wall later that year Whilst the balloon flight created entertaining suspense cinema it should remain as a monument to those who lost their lives whilst attempting to escape from East Berlin other parts of the GDR or other Sovietcontrolled states,1
Yes its an art to successfully make a slow paced thrillerThe story unfolds in nice volumes while you dont even notice it happeningFine performance by Robin Williams The sexuality angles in the film can seem unnecessary and can probably affect how much you enjoy the film However the core plot is very engaging The movie doesnt rush onto you and still grips you enough to keep you wondering The direction is good Use of lights to achieve desired affects of suspense and unexpectedness is goodVery nice 1 time watch if you are looking to lay back and hear a thrilling short story,1
Even duller if possible than the original I hope I may say that under the IMDb guidelines THE FRENCH CONNECTION at least tried to absorb European influences to complicate the conventional view of the American police detective even if the attempt was foundered by Friedkins ambivalence Americaness and general indirection The relative arthouse boom of the 1960s especially with the nouvelle vague allowed for a huge influence of European cinema in Hollywood This lent a new vigour and complexity to a weary medium and in the best of them eg BONNIE AND CLYDE early Scorcese a new subversion of received practice The original CONNECTION was part of this movement with its difficultly distanced style and antidetective figure TWO is old Hollywoods rightwing reassertion of American valuesThis is figured in the films very tiresome America vs France dialectic For instance TWO is shot like a 70s French policier It was the French of course who insisted on the greatness of American movies when they were ignored at home and this in a sense is a reclamation a warning against Gallic presumption This can be seen in the pattern of the two movies CONNECTION has French gangsters invading New York with the French style smothering the American thriller this leads to the dissolution of the detective figure and irresolution of plot the baddie got away TWO has the American returning to France with American thriller values imposed on the native genre the power of the detective is reasserted and conventional resolution is achieved This is further dramatised in Doyles relationship with French inspector Barthelmy whose dominant influence he must shake off before he can control the plotTWO seems to follow the original by undermining its detective hero From the start Doyles importance is diminished at every turn Despite the ending of CONNECTION he is considered a hero But he is an American in a foreign land and his inability to control language or customs means he cannot dominate the plot He even misreads the signs of the police force mistaking an informer for a criminal and getting him killed A detectives power comes from his power as subject to see and interpret but Doyle spends much of the movie being watched controlled an object a body literally in the scenes after he is dumped by Charnier to be viewed and interpreted In CONNECTION he instigated the action chasing the criminals forcing the plot here he is passive tied to a bed locked in a cell an addict a dependentThis loss of phallic power is predictably symbolised in the loss of his gun and the film follows a depressingly familiar Oedipal trajectory In the heroin sequences he is comforted by an old lady who says he looks like her son His drugged state is like a return to the womb robbed of adult pressures Her taking his watch reinforces the timelessness of this state doubly significant for a man whose career depends on timetables and precisionOedipus was the first detective and to avoid his fate Doyle must reject this false mother who is dissolving his unified identity and kill the father Charnier so that he can take his accepted masculine role in society Psychoanalytic theory was popular among academics in the 70sironically instigated by a Frenchman Jacques Lacan but its rare to see a film so literally full of it If all of these facts tended towards the minimising of Doyle then the films style doesnt Friedkin distanced us from his hero by refusing empathy or character motivation focusing on the mechanics of plot Here Doyle is a very conventional Hollywood hero Instead of being lost in murky long shot he is made knowable and understandable to the viewer with the traditional devices pointofview shots close ups connecting shots etcTWO is all about the fall and rise of Popeye Doyle Plot in this case is subservient to the acting which is the usual Hackman showiness The cold turkey scenes therefore despite their tediousness are not disturbing We are allowed to share rather than coldly observe this a far less discomforting experience The scenes are also shot through with a lachrymose manly sentimentality that is very American So while CONNECTION tried to imitate the complex thrillers of Jean Pierre Melville TWO does the complete opposite Melvilles LE SAMOURAI featured a gangster who started the film whole powerful outside language and charted his eventual disintegration TWO starts with a disintegrated character achieved partly through inability with language whose dominance begins when he steps outside language the concluding action sequences are largely wordless In the film the locale and language are important as they fixed and undermined the detective but as he regains his power figured in the return of his gun and the cathartic burning of the primal site of vulnerability the tower block where Charnier held him the Marseilles setting becomes more irrelevant and the mythic standoff which could take place anywhere takes over Compare the endings of the two films one admits ambiguity and despair the other absolute certainty,0

Before watching this movie from beginning to end I happened to just catch the last half hour Ordinarily I dont watch a movie if I havent seen it from the beginning but a friend had it on and once I started watching it I couldnt stopIm really surprised this movie didnt get a wide theatrical release This is quite a funny movie often gallows humor and the monster and monster truck in it are quite menacing The monster makes Leatherface look pretty and the monster truck is a like a cross between a World War I German artillery vehicle and a giant coffinA timid twentyfive yearold virgin guy is on a long drive to stop the woman he loves from getting married His exbest friend tags along and rags on him constantly Theyre menaced on the road by a vintage black hearse and the aforementioned monster truck They also pick up a hitchhiker played by the very sexy Aimee BrooksI also watched the animated trailer with the directors commentary and the electronic press kit and I found those both to be interesting I would bet that the feature commentary with the director and the two male stars is pretty enjoyable too but I have so many other movies to watch Ive never seen before,1
Yes its another great magical Muppets movie and I adore them all the characters the movies the TV show episodes its the best comedy or musical TV show ever and all the artists behind it But here they did such a rare fatal mistake and Im surely talking about the weird ending I think its very dangerous to involve that much in American drama and end a love affair by marriage We as all the poor viewers feel so free or maybe happy for the absence of its annoyance peevishness and misery So we all enjoy these stories which gather 2 cute heroes as couple in love without the legitimate bond like Mickey Mouse and Minnie Superman and Lois Lane Dick Tracy and Tess etc So with all of the previous couples and their likes I bet that you feel safe serenity and peace Therefore when you look at what the makers of this movie had already done youll be as mad as me They made the weak miserable creature Kermit marry his daily nightmare the most vexatious female ever Miss Piggy This is a historical change by the measures of the American entertainments industry And it was pretty normal to have a negative impact upon the audience whom just refused to bless or believe or being satisfied with that sudden marriage even the pathetic frog didnt have the time or the proper opportunity to think or to decide anything Therefore no wonder at all when you know that this movie is the most failure one in their cinematic serious grossing only 25 millions visvis 65 millions earned by the first one The Muppet Movie 1979 five years earlier Simply in this movie they took Manhattan and my rest too,1
Forgive me for stating the obvious but some films are good and some films are bad Of course there are extremes within those two broad categories Films such as The Godfather Saving Private Ryan and Star Wars slot comfortably into the good category At the other end of the spectrum there are those films that simply dont deserve to be mentioned by name Occasionally however someone produces a truly woeful film A film that should be singled out as a demonstration of how awful a film can be A film that is more than bad Such a film is Maiden VoyageBriefly Maiden Voyage is a story about a luxury cruise ship that is hijacked by a gang of evil criminals who demand a ransom from an equally evil scheming ships owner Of course there is an all American hero on board complete with chiselled jaw and sculptured chest who saves the dayThis is a production that plumbs new depths Everything about it is bad The acting the direction and the socalled plot are breathtakingly poor In short it is an insult to the intelligence of any unfortunate viewer Even an American viewer would be annoyed by its shortcomingsYes its that badI will resist the temptation to compose a list of things that angered me about this film However its dumberthandumb conclusion should serve as an adequate example of what I meanImagine in your mind that you are an evil hijacker and you are stood in an open lifeboat on a calm sea You are in company with the hero who holds a ticking bomb Said hero throws the bomb to you and dives overboard What would you do I dont know about you but I would throw the bomb as far as I possibly could into the sea Not this guy He watches as our hero swims away and then he tries to disarm the bomb with unfortunate for him results Enough said Such a demise would merit a mention in the Darwin Awards website and might also be a suitably apt conclusion to the production teams lives,0
Although Cinderella isnt the obvious choice for a sequel I love Jaq and Gus so I didnt hesitate The format of the mice writing a book for Cinderella was an inspired one I enjoy writing stories myself and hope children will be encouraged by this The three stories are cute amusing although the songs were forgettable Jaq and Gus were my favourite characters but I also enjoyed seeing Lucifer Bruno the Mice Chorus and all the rest Pom Pom proved the perfect companion for Lucifer and I liked the Governess A sequel done right for a change My rating 810,1
I had read an article about Dan Jansens Olympic and personal journey before seeing this movie Im always intrigued by a story of hope and overcoming life altering events and this was no exceptionThe background of the characters that is provided gives you a sense of the familys closeness and how they positively affected each others lives I cant speak to the accuracy of specific details in this movie it is customary to take some creative license when organizing a script However the spirit of Dan and his family is what matters hereIts a worthwhile movie of a story that should be told I felt empathy for the characters and cheered at the end,1
I usually can tolerate twisted movies but this one is really a sick obsessive selfabsorbed movieFirstly the writerdirector is totally a selfabsorbed guy full of sick jokes that are not funny at all Secondly he is also a sick pervert who manipulates and poisons childrens mind I cant believe my ears when I heard the sick and perverted monologues spoken by the kidsI really feel sorry for Zane Adlum and Devon Matthews They are both very talented but fell prey to Eric Schaeffers dirty littleknown movieAnd what the hell happened to Eric Mabius good looking face I mean he met this girl that hes supposed to marry but he wasnt in the wedding In fact there is this bald guy in his place Did time really fly that fastAnyway dont waste your time to see this movie unless you want to be poisoned and manipulated by one sick Eric Schaeffer,0
Three girls the youngest descendents of the Gaylord family one of Americas most royal families are orphaned at a young age Right before he goes off to France to fight in WWI their father tells the oldest Fiona never to sell the land By the time the sisters have become adults they have had to squander most of their money to pay for lawyers to defend their property Through certain loopholes in the fathers will a man named Charles Barclay stands to gain possession of the Gaylord land on which he wants to build a complex called Barclay Circle Barclay is actually based on John D Rockefeller who was buying up land and buildings from affluent families in New York so he could build Rockefeller CenterThis film deals mostly with the melodramatic concerns of the three sisters Fiona well played by Barbara Stanwyck although its certainly not to be counted as one of her best roles seems like a cold domineering woman and it becomes clear that she has some skeletons in her closet Susanna played by Nancy Coleman is a little ditsy and completely in love with a young modern artist named Gig Young Colemans was my favorite performance in the film Evelyn played by Geraldine Fitzgerald is a rather pretentious seductress with a monocle who married into noble blood in England but that doesnt stop her from trying to steal Gig from her sister The three sisters are developed quite well but as is the major trend in The Gay Sisters never well enough Charles Barclay is played by George Brent He isnt very good Well he would be satisfactory if the story had played out the way it should have but he always seems like a scumbag in the film When were asked to sympathize with him late in the film its impossible Gig Young is played by huh Gig Young No hes not playing himself What happened is that the actor who had acted in several movies previously under his real name Byron Barr was pressured by Warner Brothers to change his name to something more catchy Im not sure who made the final choice but he eventually changed his screen name to Gig Young after the character whom he plays in The Gay Sisters Weird eh Young is quite good through most of the film but the script does some unfortunate things with his character late in the film which ultimately harm the audiences sympathy for him In two other supporting roles Helen Thimig and Gene Lockhart are quite goodThe Gay Sisters had great potential to turn out to be one of the great cinematic family sagas The characters are all interesting as are their situations Unfortunately the script never strives for anything more than the simplest melodrama If it had made the interrelationships of all the major characters more complex fleshed out for example the rivalry between Evelyn and Susanna or made the flashback more intricate the film could have been fantastic It also could have fleshed out the prologue more let us know more about the Gaylord family We need to care more about the characters and we need to sympathize with them more And the ending needed some major fixing It basically just gives up at the end Fionas problems are solved so poorly that it hurts Whatever sympathy her character had gained as the film progressed falls apart Its also far too happy This story seems moving towards tragedy or maybe just a sense of historical significance or loss And we still hate Barclay And the conflict between the two sisters and Gig is never solved As bad as Fionas story ends Susannas Gigs and Evelyns is even worseI still liked the film Its thoroughly watchable even if it doesnt involve us like other great films of the era 710 mostly for its potential It should have been remade or the novel should have been readapted at some point during the studio era It is too dated to be remade now The 1950s would have been the best time during the time of films like Giant,1
Short synopsis This film opens with soldiers being released from the company of men One of them pursues another with a weird scheme the other repeatedly refuses Later they both get trapped in an office building in which they want to crack a safe during the Christmas holidays Hostility turns into playful banter and then into a desperate fight for survival during the bantering they lose all drinkable liquids so it is really serious With exposed well built and well oiled torsos they ram a hole into a wall and finally manage to escape only to find out that they have been betrayed and set up by women One gets caught the other remains free and is not given away by his companion A last encounter a last light for a cigarette adieu lami farewell friendI found it hard not to see closet homosexuals in the two main characters played by classical heman superstars Alain Delon and Charles Bronson They are obviously attracted to each other their treatment of women is abominable and marked by contempt throughout The whole story seems to have a strong symbolic undertow a little like Deliverance It is also very stylish The safe the two men want to crack is in a for the time ultra modern glass and aluminum tower It is the seat of a publicity firm so there are many fancy posters and wall coverings around The wardrobe is also very good The ultra stylish Citroen DS maybe the most modern and elegant car of all times features large in this movie perhaps a subtle kind of product placementI can recommend this movie for the actors performances alone Delon and Bronson are really sharing the top billing in a manner that struck me as very fair and sporting Both do a considerable amount of acrobatics I have never seen Bronson better than here he really acts and speaks French throughout with a heavy accent buy very passably indeed And it is certainly the man himself we hear So the French language version is highly recommended The police inspector who pursues the two is played by on of my favorite Franch character actors Bernard Fresson who was Gene Hackmans partner in French Connection II He is the best brainy police inspector I know Also very good is former child actress Brigitte Fossey as the young ingnue who as it turns out is not so Innocent as it first seemsAnyone who expects the old inanout of classical heist movies might be disappointed with this film For those with a little patience this will be a rewarding experience full of novel and original ideas and directorial quirks although it my be a little too brutal and sadistic for its own sake,1
I live in Rome where the Turkish director of this film lives and works From my Italian friends I have heard many good things about his filmsso after seeing the preview I really wanted to see Cuore Sacro I am deeply disappointed one of the most pompous pseudoreligious highly improbable and naive films I love film but this one is really heavy and bad The main character is really crazy and should be locked up in a madhousemade me sympathise with the negative character of an aunt who runs a dirtydealing company that only wants to make moneyand I consider myself an anticapitalistthat bad,0
As far as the Muppet line goes however this is not the best nor the second best This was marketed towards the kiddies but has some dark and emotionally upsetting adult moments to which parents may not wish to expose their children One of which showcases Miss Piggy going postal in a jealous rage which lasts basically throughout the duration of this workBeyond that however the story is progressive and highly entertaining One scene in which Joan Rivers and Miss PIggy go berserk in a department store is simply hilarious And there are other parts of this work which contain the same level of levity and funI like this very much and enjoy it still todayIt rates a 7610 fromthe Fiend,1
A superb and compelling drama about the hunt for the notorious Russian serial killer Andrea Chikatilo Magnificent performance from Stephen Rea as the forensic scientist put in charge of the investigation who finds the biggest obstacle to his progress is the Russian government in particular the old communist party members who want to maintain a closed societyThe film is has an underlying theme about the decline of the communist society and progress in the hunt for the killer is reflected by progress in social and political change in Russia which is subtly put across There is a conflict of old ways and new ways and these are represented by the two viewpoints of Reas superior played by Donald Sutherland and Rea himself These are at first polarised with Sutherland high in system looking down and Rea low on the ground looking up However they have a common cause to catch the serial killerThroughout the film the relationship between these two develops and the tension gradually eases until at the end of the movie Rea and Sutherland and Rea and Sutherland have mutual respect for each other the killer is caught and Glasnost symbolically comes Excellent scriptFurther credits go to Sutherlands performance which is superb and sympathetic Jeffrey DeMunn as the killer whom we despise but cant hate and Max Von Sydow who is thoroughly convincing as the humble psychologist who risks his reputation to help,1
This is an very good movie This is one that I would rent over and over again It is not like your normal superhero movie This movie blends comedy action and great special effects It even has a person in it that does a lot of voices on The Simpsons William H Macy is the bomb,1
This film really got off to a great start It had the potential to turn into a really heartrending romantic love story with cinematography that recorded the love between Harlan and Tobe in long poetic and idyllic scenes It really didnt need to be anything more than that and for a moment there I became excited that someone was finally making a beautiful film for its own sake another timeless classic a modern myth perhaps Why oh why then mess it up halfway through by making the lead character Nortonanother psycho Maybe Im missing the point but do we really need another film about psychos Or is this need in Hollywood to portray the sick side of human nature indicative of a more general malaise in the movie industry For a moment there I was going to make a mental note of the directors name now Im left feeling indifferent At least it should be added in the films defense that all the actors seemed to invest in their roles Also Evan Rachel Wood is really lovely to look at and a good actress with lots of potential,0
It is hard to believe that anyone could take such a great book and and make such a terrible movieImagine King Kong being recast as an organ grinders monkey and Fay Wrays part being played by a young boy How about Elton John as RamboThis movie is even worse than the TV remake of The Night of the HunterBy using the title Watchers and Dean Koontzs name the makers of this movie should be sued for fraud by readers of the book who expected a reasonably accurate adaptation of the bookRead the book I have never talked to anyone who didnt like it Another good book is The Winner by David Baldachi,0
Alleged scream queen Debbie Rochon and her group of frontier prostitutes travel west to the title location and encounter grisly killings that turn out to be the work of a cult of exConfederate psychopaths attempting to resurrect the south through pointless massacreAction and suspense take a backseat to loads of boring dialog and uninteresting character developmentBilly Drago is good in the thankless not to mention pointless role of the town mortician but everything else about this wannabe slasher western is extremely poor including the town and the fort both of which look like modern made western tourist traps and costumes that look like they were bought at Party CityDo yourself a big favor and watch Ravenous instead,0
This very forced attempt to fuse Robert Altman and Quentin Tarantino who is wildly overrated himself is neither informative nor entertaining The character development is arbitrary and unbelievable especially in the final scene of the thugs and the little boy as other reviewers have noted Also a couple of humorous moments aside the film is not as funny black humor or otherwise as the director seems to think it is,0
Hard to imagine what they were thinking of when they made this movie ie the writers directors producers actors editors etc Christopher Plummer veteran of 129 movies frolics along among scores of other actors with apparently no more motivation than to collect a paycheck I guess there is nothing wrong with that but once they are paid that doesnt mean anyone has to watch itIt bugs me that there are actually good reviews for this movie here at imdb Art If you want to see art go to an art gallery dont watch this movie Comedy Watch a rerun of the Flintstones about the same plot with less time wastedDabney Coleman gives his usual performance for better or worse And some of the young actors may have gotten some good experience from doing this movie But Plummer It was embarrassing to watch his performance in fact I was positively transfixed on him throughout the movie knowing this was Plummer of Sound of Music fame I see from his bio that he called Sound of Music sound of mucus so guess he didnt like it as much as the 100s of millions who liked him in itI wonder if today he was asked how do you rate Sound of Music compared to Where the Heart Is what would he sayProbably something like Where the Money Is,0
I really enjoyed this documentary about Kenny and Spencers attempt to pitch The Dawn Was a great look at how outsiders try to get to the inside to make it big The story was put together well and organized in an interesting manner that made the film flow well Certainly worth a watch My only complaint is that their appeared to be no closure Perhaps that is part of the point We expect it but in reality that is not what happened or usually happensThe film is also a great way to see the personality of Kenny and Spencer outside of their Canadian television show You can see a bit of what is yet to come I look forward to a chance to see The Papal Chase,1
What if Somerset Maugham had written a novel about a coal miner who decided to search for transcendental enlightenment by trying to join a country club If he had he could have called it The Razors Edge since the KathaUpanishad tells us The sharp edge of a razor is difficult to pass over thus the wise say the path to Salvation is hard But Maugham decided to stick with the wellbred class and so we have Darryl F Zanucks version of Larry Darrell recently returned from WWI carefully groomed well connected in society and determined to find himself by becoming a coal miner Or as Maugham tells us This is the young man of whom I write He is not famous It may be that when at last his life comes to an end he will leave no more trace of his sojourn on this earth than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the surface of the water Yet it may be that the way of life he has chosen for himself may have an ever growing influence over his fellow men so that long after his death perhaps it will be realized that lived in this age a very remarkable creature The Razors Edge has all of Zanucks cultural taste that money could buy Its so earnest so sincereso selfimportant As Larry goes about his search for wisdom working in mines on merchant ships climbing a Himalayan mountain to learn from an ancient wise man we have his selfish girl friend Isabel played by Gene Tierney his tragic childhood chum played by Anne Baxter the girlfriends snobbish and impeccably clad uncle played by Clifton Webb and Willie Maugham himself played by Herbert Marshall taking notes The movie is so insufferably smug about goodness that the only thing that perks it up a bit is Clifton Webb as Elliot Templeton If I live to be a hundred I shall never understand how any young man can come to Paris without evening clothes Webb has some good lines but we wind up appreciating Clifton Webb not Elliot Templeton Zanuck wanted a prestige hit for Twentieth Century when he bought the rights to Maughams novel He waited a year until Tyrone Power was released from military service He made sure there were welldressed extras by the dozens a score that sounds as if it were meant for a cathedral and he even wrote some of the scenes himself The effort is as selfconscious as a fat man wearing a rented tux Despite Hollywoods view of things in The Razors Edge I can tell you that for most people hard work doesnt bring enlightenment just weariness and low pay After nearly twoandahalf hours we last see Larry carrying his duffle bag on board a tramp steamer in a gale Hes going to work his way back to America from Europe with a contented smile on his face My dear Somerset Maugham says to Isabel at the same time in an elaborately decorated parlor Larry has found what we all want and what very few of us ever get I dont think anyone can fail to be better and nobler kinder for knowing him You see my dear goodness is after all the greatest force in the worldand hes got it Larry and the audience both need a healthy dose of Dramamine Maugham lest we forget was a fine writer of plays novels essays and short stories To see how the movies could do him justice watch the way some of his short stories were brought to the screen in Encore Trio and Quartet And instead of wasting time with Larry Darrell spend some time with Lawrence Durrell The Alexandria Quartet is a good read,0
Of all the kungfu films made through the 70s and 80s this is one that has developed a real cult following With the exception of all the films Bruce Lee starred in this is a film that has stood the test of time and its due to the unique story An aging kungfu master tells his last pupil Yang Tieh Sheng Chiang about five pupils he has trained in the past All five wore masks and nobody has seen the face of each other and they have all been trained differently Their specialty in kungfu is the name they have adopted like Lizard Snake Centipede Toad and Scorpion The master called them the Poison Clan and he does not know what has happened to them so he wants Tieh to find them and help the ones that are doing good to stop the others that are evil An old man who was once a member of the Poison Clan has a map to where he has hidden a lot of money and he seems to be a target Tieh does not know what they look like so he has to mingle in society and try and figure out who they are Tieh has discovered that the Snake is Hung Wen Tung Pai Wei and along with Tang Sen Kue Feng Lu who is the Centipede they kill a family to find the map A map is found by a mystery man who turns out to be the Scorpion but know one knows who he is A local policeman named Ho Yung Sin Philip Kwok investigates the murders along with his partner Ma Chow Chien Sun Sin has a friend called Li Ho Meng Lo who is the Toad and they do know of each others identity The Snake bribes the local officials to pin the murders on Li Ho and while he is in prison he is tortured and killed When Sin finds out he teams up with Tieh and together they go to combat Tung and Kue This film was directed by Cheh Chang and he was a very special director when it came to these films Chang was not your run of the mill kungfu director and his films always had a special quality to them While most martial arts films deal with revenge Chang did not use that as a central theme Even though there is some revenge going on later in this story this film is more complex than that Five men trained by the same master in different ways and wearing masks Then they are all in the same area and not knowing who the other is Very unique story makes this film different from all the others and most of Changs stories were in a class all by themselves I wouldnt exactly put it in the same league as Enter The Dragon because Bruce Lee was a worldwide icon and the martial arts he exhibited were more authentic looking This film still has some impossible feats like clinging to sides of walls and all the flipping through the air but this film isnt necessarily about fight scenes Its more about the intrigue of the story and the characters that are involved That alone makes this different from all the other kungfu films Very well made with a unique story,1
i cant believe how dumb this movie truly is the storyline written by keira knightleys mother is what ruins the movie to the extreme it is straight out dull absurd and makes absolutely no sense whatsoeverthis movie lagged so bad for most of it especially at the beginning the story just kept going on and on about their everyday flirts with each other often times seeming like a threesome in this movie you have an annoying deadbeat couple the poet and his wife who are complete total drunks from the start the wife sleeps around with other men to make ends meet while the poet is a pervert who thrives on cheap boos and women the wife who waaayyyyyy too quickly becomes friends with his former childhood lover played by keira suddenly gets jealous knowing full well that the two were lovers since they were kids something doesnt seem right herei mean come on get with the program lady whatd you expectbottom line is former lovers meet again with new wife embracing it then gets jealous then former woman lover gets married and her husband gets jealous bombards the crazy drunk couples home crazy husband calls police and they end up going to court for the mans attempted murder charges thats it summed up in a nutshellthis movie had its moments such as the quality and good acting by cillian murphy but other than that i cannot believe i watched it i complained about it during the movie and some family members watching it with me fell asleep i decided to give it a chance and i should have stuck to my first instincts,0
It must be so difficult to tell a story where not much happens yet still grip the viewers attention I think this short film achieves this with effortless quality Rutger has an amazing voice that is very soothing wise and fatherly Im not gay it reminds of the qualities that Robert Redford has in narrating The end is very sad but beautiful One wonders how long Harry has left will he be lonely and will he get to say his goodbyes Also one gets annoyed at Mr Hauer for not getting involved in more work of this caliber Lets hope he continues to do fine work in Holland and stays away from HollywoodWorth Watching,1
I was Unlike most of the reviewers not born in the 80s I was born on may 14th 1994 Despite this my life was very much in the style of the 80s When other kids had playstations I was playing Zelda on my NES etc Now this movie holds a special place in my heart already despite me being only 15 years old at the time of writing this review I because of my 80s style early Childhood watched many TV shows and saw Many movies that other kids didnt see and this movie was one of those and one of the greatest tooIt starts off in the Los Angeles home of Alvin Seville Simon Seville Theodore Seville and David Seville David the Chipmunks adoptive father is in a rush to get to the airport as he is going on a business trip around Europe His taxi is almost there and The Chipmunks help him pack While they are talking Alvin expresses his will to come with Dave and to see the world Even though technically Dave is only going to Europe so to Alvin apparently only America and Europe qualify as The World David is leaving the Chipmunks in the care of Miss Miller much to the displeasure of the boys Soon Dave is off to the airport and the Chipmunks are left at home with Miss Miller Later at a local Caf the Chipmunks are playing a game of Around the World in 30 days against the ChipettesBrittany Jeanette and Eleanore After losing the game to Brittany after having his Hot air Balloon eaten out of the sky by a crocodile Alvin gets in an argument with Brittany about who would really win a race around the world Two diamond smugglers sitting at a nearby table Klaus and Claudia Furschtien overhear their argument and needing a safe way of transporting their diamonds over the world decide to fool the children into delivering them for them They set up a race around the world where each team will have to deposit a doll in their own likeness Secretely filled with diamonds at drop offs around the world and receive a doll in the opposing teams likeness secretely filled with the payment for the diamonds to varify that they were there The winning team would then receive a 100000 dollar reward They do this because they believe that Jamal An Interpol agent who has been hot on their heels for some times now would never suspect them because they are just kids However this seems to be redundant because on their travels the kids do not have to go through any security checks and are never even questioned about the dolls I suspect that neither would Klaus or Claudia if they had taken the diamonds there personally And so begins a great adventure This film is a classic and I see no reason why anyone would not like it It features great animation and topnotch voice acting not to mention the Kickass music Pardon my french P My favorite song is without a shred of doubt The Girls and Boys of Rock and Roll An amazing rock song that cannot be topped Its also my favorite moment in the film Other notable songs include Getting LuckyKind of Suggestive for a kids film eh and My Mother as well as Wooly Bully and Off to see the world Not to mention the main theme of the movie heard during the opening credits performed by the Royal London Philharmonic Orchestra The scene with My mother still brings a tear to my eye In relation to the song Getting Lucky I first didnt think anything of it but when I grew older and learned about life it became clear that that song was a little bit suggestive That song along with the fact that the animators insist on the audience knowing the color of the Chipettes panties This is especially apparent in the scene in Egypt when the Chipettes are being chased by the Arabian Princes men when Eleanor leans over the side of the hot air balloon basket and her skirt defies gravity completely While this does nothing to draw from the overall quality of the film its one of those unexplained things like why nobody in the world seems to mind that there are 4feet tall Chipmunks walking around and speaking in incredibly highpitched voices and treat them just like they would any human child Anyway A bit after that scene the Chipettes discover the diamonds in the dolls and decide to go find the Chipmunks and get home The Direction of Janice Karman perfects this movie as she and her husband Ross Bagdasarian Jr know the characters better than anyone They even do the voices of the Chipmunks and the Chipettes Ross doing the voices for Alvin and Simon as well as Dave and Janice doing the voices for All the Chipettes and Theodore Speaking of male characters that are voiced by female voice actresses Nancy Cartwright The voice of Bart Simpson makes an appearance in this movie She plays the part of the Arabian Prince a very small but important role The ending is of course a happy one The Crooks have been caught the loose ends tied and The film ends when the Children Dave and Miss Miller are driving into the sunset Alvin complaining about not having gotten his 100000 dollar reward for winning the race which annoys Dave until he finally yells ALVIN and the screen fades to blackClassic ending by the way I hope you found my review of this movie useful and if you havent seen this flick give it a watch Its worth the money This Nostalgic classic from the 80s gets a solid 10 out of 10 Headin for the top Dont you know we never stop believing now,1
I watched the DVD of this movie which also comes with an excellent commentary track in English It seems in Cambodia the subtitles in English say the character is speaking Thai but the movie says Cambodiaa very violent evil man is raising boys to be killers using starvation and training them to fight and kill He sends Pang to kill some people in China and during the killings a cops partner is killed The cop Wai is a loose cannon who is worried about his father who is also a cop who was shot and is in a coma Wais chief is his dads friend and is worried about Wais erratic behavior He doesnt know Wai was the one who caught his dad in dealing with drug dealers and shot him and put him into the coma Pang escapes and hides in a squalid landfill shack where he meets a woman who came here to find her mother and keeps repeating her father wont let her leave Pang doesnt speak Chinese and doesnt understand this but saves her from her father who appears to be having sex with her maybe this is the reason for Cat III Wai becomes more and more obsessed with getting Pang but Pang is almost unstoppable Even after Pang steals a boat and takes the woman to his home where they are married and she becomes pregnant Wai follows and joins the evil man whos training the boysmaking a deal to fight and train so he can get Pang There is a big showdown between Wai and Pang with the terribly abused woman the major victim and leaving Wai dead and Pang cutting out his child from the dead mother only to die and leave him as the possible next boy to be raised as a killer This film is beautifully photographed with an excellent soundtrack There are many very brutal violent scenes The woman having a long nail pulled out of her foot Knives to the neck and torso Guns fired directly to the head And several very intense beatings It maybe grim intense and downbeat but it is definitely worth seeing,1
This movie is Jackies best I still cant get enough of watching some of his best stunts ever I also like the bad guys in this movie the old man looks like a Chinese version of John Howard Unlike some of Jackies other work this movie has also got a great story line and i recommend it to all of Jackies fans,1
The animation quality here is decidedly below par IMO regardless of the age of the OAV The plot itself makes sense but the characters dontThis might sound picky but considering that the city of Olympus is almost exclusively populated by living machines would YOU feel comfortable there as a human Would any machine ever emulate human arrogance shortsightedness and greed quite so effectively I doubt it There are some pointers towards this in the movie but only when the team can be bothered to put them in by and large the bioroids or whatever they are are interchangeable with human characters Seems sloppy to meThe main characters seem to have some kind of emotional entanglement though no light is shed on this Little light is shed on the backstory at all a great pity The short length of the film coupled with the focus on mecha and the crime means that we dont see any character depth The groundworks all down yet were left with no finished product A cropped version of this OAV would have made a great TV episode once some character subplots had been establishedThe highlights of this short film are the mecha designs and the actionespionageThe flaws really start to show through once youve had a chance to digest all the goingson so I couldnt recommend this for owning but its certainly worth a watch or two Whilst this review is mostly negative I really do think its worth your time to watch this but its not something to rush out and buy In a nutshell A watchable wasted opportunity,1
As a Jane Eyre fan I was excited when this movie came out At last I thought someone will make this book into a movie following the story actually written by the author Wrong If the casting director was intending to cast a Jane who was plain he certainly succeeded However surely he could have found one who could also act Where was the tension between Jane and Rochester Where was the spooky suspense of the novel when the laughter floated into the night seemingly from nowhere Where was the sparkle of the child who flirted and danced like her mother Finally why was the plot changed at the end One wonders whether the screenwriters had actually read the book What a disappointment,0
I didnt expect much from the movie so am not all that disappointed Carrie looked ugly Mr Big had his eyebrows colored with crayons and Samantha didnt say f Charlottes kid was annoying to watch as she was in too many scenesthe title could easily have been SATC Parents Night Out Camera angles just werent that good especially regarding Carries face There was a token black woman thrown in whose character doesnt have a proper exit and too few appearances by the gay men friends who seemed thrown in with no purpose anyway Samanthas going back and forth from LA choked the story flow especially when she comes in for Fashion Week and nothing happens The movie seems to have been made in rush because it could have been good but scenes were just thrown in to show different outfits or to offer viewers a chance to jump back in the show without adding much to the story of the movie,0
I simply never tire of watching FREEBIRD My husband was an extra so I was involved from the start Have kept in touch with Jon and have helped out with promoting the film both in Cinemas and now the DVD release Even to the extent of distributing promotional postcards on cross channel ferries and various places throughout France FREEBIRD was expertly written and directed with the perfect combination of fun and serious moments plus choice casting Only Phil Daniels could fit the role of Grouch Great privilege to meet Jon and the cast at the party following the premier in January Anything else you want doing Jon just ask either email or phone you know how to get me Sue xx,1
So well made no CGI crap Has anyone else been on the Jumping Crocs tour of Darwins Adelaide River before Black Water was WAY realistic Rogue was a bit cringeworthyThought the blonde chick was excellent in it havent really seen her before And the other chick is a babe she is always excellent V suspenseful I would compare it to Jaws over any other man eating animal flick Got the hole Aussie thing down pat without going OTT with struths and crikeys as well Loved it,1
It is amazing to me what passes for entertainment today maybe I am a dinosaur from the fifties and I am out of touch with todays movie going generation and apparently that is the case with regards to this movie since so many people loved it I found it foul and vulgar I havent said that about many movies in my life but this one fits the bill The humor is sophomoric and crude I am not a politically correct person and even I found the gay jokes not only not funny but downright offensive Im not gay The main character in the movie is not even a likable person just pathetic When the movie was finally over i heard a number of people comment on how disappointed they were in what they had just pay good money to see,0
OK Not bad movie making if it were from an original script BUT IT IS NOTWhich part of in this story there are no women except for Foulata and Gagoola introduction by Haggard did the producers directors and writers not understand I mean it is pretty plain English I understood it at age 10 The beauty of KSM is that it contains a spectacular description of three different worlds the colonial Africa the unforgiving desert and Kukuanaland a hidden and isolated kingdom That should be more than enough for even the most mediocre of producers to work with But nooo they have to throw romance into it Pathetic Suggestion to all you poor souls who actually thought this would be close to the book Give it up Until a Peter Jackson wannabe comes along and does it right you may as well keep rereading the tome BTW there is a sequel book actually a prequel called Allans wife It gives background to the story of Quatermain It is a bit creepy but good,0
Madonna has been rocking the boat for over 20 years and with that comes a lot of experience obviously and a lot of knowledge She was never the one to think about yesterday au contraire she seemed to know what is going to be popular tomorrow She bravely takes all the new trends technologies and incorporates them into her own acts Her world tours have never been average When Madonna performs she gives 120 everything is bigger better theatrical and meaningful She takes inspirations from East West and makes then unique Everything is given a deeper meaning and The Confessions Tour is not different From the very beginning you find yourself sitting on the edge of the chair She starts with bang then she does brave circus poses on a horse high up in the sky she does everything she can to entertain you She remakes her own songs giving them a modern feel She sings on a disco cross she almost comes in the middle of the stage and with her amazing dance crew that know no dimensions of fear the show is absolutely more than you bargained for Its a spectacle an audiovisual orgasm that cannot be put in words Lucky are the ones who actually experienced seeing Madonna on stage Pushing fifty she is still in an incredible form Recent Sticky and Sweet Tour is even more groundbreaking which proves nothing else that Madonna was is and ever be the one and the only queen of pop,1
SPOILERS FOLLOW and I havent even seen itLet me guess the murder is related to the evil property developer wanting to develop the riverside and Dickens was murdered because he was trying to uncover a similar dastardly plot If anybody whos seen it could let me know if Im half right youll have saved me the time it might take to watch something worthwhile and the rest of us will know to steer clear of both this film and its enthusiastic reviewers On the other hand it sounds intriguing but if it was any good would it really be given away with a Sunday rag And what sort of track record does Foley have anywaySo as a public service I managed to sit through it Its worse than Swept Away Really Ive read stories by eightyearolds with more drama than this Truly awful And I was half right,0
I can see what this film was intending to do Unfortunately it just never quite completes the deal The reality crime aspect works fine and the shots are all first rate In fact quite a few of the scenes are incredibly evocative in a moody sort of way Notably the silhouette of the detective talking to the beat up woman the scene of the detectives going through the garbage and the father tying flies On occasion s few scenes bog down in too much dialog Instead of showing the viewer the writer treats it too much like a book But the real problem lies in the editing The story does not flow It fails to make a whole out of the sum of the parts In the end you are confused as to what is actually happening Those who like this sort of detective movie like to follow along piecing together the puzzle at the same time the lead characters do With such poor editing it is difficult if not nearly impossible to do this,0
First let me just comment on what I liked about the movie The special effects were fantastic and very rarely did I feel like I was watching a video game There that is the last nice thing I have to say about this film In fact I would just like everyone reading this to take note that I cant even put into words how hard it was for me to write this review without swearing I have innumerable complaints about the film but four major complaints jump to mind My first major complaint has to do with the incredible cheesiness of the plot twist if you can call it that since most people probably saw it coming a mile away where Loiss 5 yearold son turns out to be the superpowered child of Superman When the crying superchild throws a piano at Lexs henchman to save his mother I almost got up and left the theater Singer could have made a much better Superman movie without resorting to cheap gimmicks like a seemingly fragile but latently superpowered illegitimate child Its been 5 days since I saw the movie and I still want to vomit My next major complaint has to do with the fact that Superman lifts a continent made out of kryptonite up into outer space It doesnt take comic book guy from the Simpsons to point out whats wrong with that I dont know how many comic books Brian Singer has read but when Superman is exposed to even a small amount of kryptonite he barely has the strength to stay on his feet Whoever had the idea to have him fly a large island made out of his greatest weakness into space has no business being associated with any Supermanrelated projects ever again The concept is as ridiculous as making a Dracula movie where the title character has a stake through his heart and still manages to fly a spaceship made out of garlic into the sun Why not just have Superman eat kryptonite He can eat it and then brush his teeth with it and then go to sleep in kryptonite pajamas Thats not any more absurd then having him hoist a continent of kryptonite into space and then fall powerless through the atmosphere without burning up in reentry or splattering all over central park when he hits the ground My third major complaint has to do with the fact that Singer slaps moviegoers across the face with religious symbolism the entire movie I have to take issue with his characterization of Superman as the only son of a Godlike Jorel sent to Earth to be a savior Jorel wasnt allwise he was just a scientist And he didnt send his son to earth to be a savior he threw him in a rocket and hurriedly fired it into space because his planet was about to explode Ill buy the Christ allegory if Brian Singer can show me the part in the Bible where God sends Christ to Earth because Heaven was about to explode and then radioactive pieces of Heaven become Christs primary weakness Furthermore the crucifixion scene where Luthor stabs Superman in the side with a kryptonite spear just makes me want to slam my face into a brick until Im too braindead to notice the brazenly obvious and inappropriate symbolism that will be tainting the man of steel for the foreseeable future They might as well rename this movie Superman Returns the Passion of the ChristAnd speaking of Luthor my last major complaint has to do with Singers depiction of Lex Luthor Lex Luthor is a shrewd coldhearted business tycoon who is more apt to run for President which he does in the comics than try to destroy the world The man wants money and power he wants to be in charge not wreck everything Yet the Luthor we see Superman Returns as well as all the previous Superman movies is a wacky theatrical dunce who comes up with zany schemes to destroy the world If Singer had the slightest loyalty to the characters instead of the quite awful previous Superman movies this film might not be such an unbearable travesty Maybe Singers next project can be a Batman movie where he focuses on the interpretation of Batman from 1960s TV show ZAM WHAP POWTo summarize I dont know what I hate more the movie itself or the fact that so many people seem to be giving it good reviews Everyone is entitled to their opinion but if you dont hate this movie then your opinion is wrong I sincerely encourage anyone who reads this not to see this movie if you havent already Dont see it dont buy it when it comes out on DVD dont rent itbasically dont contribute any money towards it in any way This movie does not deserve to make any money In fact I think that for every person that sees this movie Bryan Singer should be fined 45 billion dollars If youre a Superman fan and you really want to see this movie just bend over and have someone kick you in the balls and youll get the same experience without having to waste 2 hours of your time,0
I have to say this is one of the worst films Ive ever seen They had a pretty good storyline to go on but than the messed it up so badly First of all the cast is all wrong where did that van peeblecrap actor btw and puff daddy come from It looks like Carlito has come from the hood and used to hang about with some real idiots This film doesnt do Carlitos Way any justice Im so happy that the sequel Carlitos Way came out first if I had seen this rubbish first I would have never given the pacino version a chance And anyway pacino is supposed to have read this story thought its crap and did the sequel instead Carlitos Way Rise to Power 1 out of 10 Carlitos Way 9 out of 10,0
Horrible writing directing and acting The writerdirector has portrayed Southerners especially Southern law enforcement as ignorant backwoods homophobic and racist a very popular yet ignorant stereotype that the film industry loves to perpetuate The acting or overacting and the writing came across as amateurish and low budget The plot line is the same old stale Hollywood story of the mean ol racist and homophobic rednecks who are ultimately defeated by the enlightened people from Newwww Yoke CeetyI was raised in the small Louisiana town where this movie was filmed and looked forward to seeing the film but was immediately disappointed during the first few minutes of the movie The start of the film depicts a gay bar located in the swamps of Louisiana How ridiculous a concept There are a lot of gays and gay bars in south Louisiana but no gay bars in the swamps or small towns of Louisiana We then are introduced to the sheriff who uses the phrases homuhsexl in the worst southern drawl and overdone performance ever Then there is the scene where the local police are watching porno on duty in the police station I could go on and on about the horrible cheesy acting or the stale stereotypes or ridiculous scenesThis director and his crew were welcomed into this small friendly town and shown true southern hospitality The townspeople of Lake Arthur and the state of Louisiana were only to be insulted and degraded in the final editing The good people of Lake Arthur were excited and enamored with Hollywood being in town not knowing that in the end they would be portrayed as ignorant racist and homophobic country bumpkins in a low budget amateur movie that went straight to DVD My advice skip this one or watch it on late night Cinemax if it ever makes their rotation,0

This is a silly spoof of private eye thrillers as a novelistMichael Cainis called upon to ghostwrite an autobiography of a colorful waning Hollywood starMickey Rooney At times silliness becomes obnoxious This is not Cain at his best Rooney is way over the top Notable support from Lizabeth Scott Lionel Stander and the comely Nadia Cassini Not easy to watch,0
Frightmare begins with a horror movie icon killing a director and then his servant before he is laid to rest This icon who has some Christopher Lee qualities to him then continues to haunt those around him when a group of horror film society students steal his corpse from the mausoleum he is inThe first ten minutes is wellfilmed good writing and lots of potential for murderous mayhem But the film drags in the middle although thankfully not as much as House of Death and never really gets that initial spurt of energy backLots of the deaths are confusing as they seem to have people just falling over scared when they see a floating coffin or other odd things Twice we see poisonous gas being used But the box promises that this horror star will be the embodiment of all the monsters he has played Boy is that false advertising unless he spent his career playing boring old men who take naps and watch MatlockThe general principle of the film is decent horror society kids stealing a corpse of a dead icon A modern equivalent digging up Vincent Price or Peter Cushing would make a great film Maybe a remake is in order if that wouldnt be too disrespectful Sometimes theory doesnt come across as well in application and this film offers that exampleThe only redeeming quality of this film besides the beginning is the brief appearance of a very young Jeffrey Combs I saw him and thought thats Jeffrey Combs but felt I was mistaken as the box never mentioned him But sure enough Combs was present A note to this movies filmmakers mention Combs on the cover of the DVD youll sell more copies if if you would be deceiving customers If youre a Jeffrey Combs diehard check out this early role Otherwise I cannot offer this as a great selection for a horror movie marathon Let me suggest Intruder or Popcorn as those are both pretty decent and will stand the test of time,0
Andy Lau stars in another cop undercover tale Daniel Wu plays Nick who is working for the cops and is also close to the top of a drug dealing gangLau The movie begins as we watch the police try to make a drug bust only to see it go to pieces We then are introduced to the young drug addicted mother and her daughter living near Nick and to his cronies and the cops and 45 minutes in I shut off the movie and put on the news Well acted and great to look at this is as uninvolving a movie as Ive seen in a long time Its not bad as such its just you really dont care I mean I really didnt care at all I actually started to do something else completely forgetting I had on a subtitled movie on thats how much I didnt care I wish I could have hated the film but the film is such a nonentity that it made almost no impression on me its not even something I could sleep to its just something to ignore Come on the box called it the Chinese Scarfacewhat after he was dead This is one to avoid,0
Some very interesting camera work and a story with much potential But it never comes together as anything more than a students graduate thesis in film schoolThere are two primary reasons for this Fist there is not a single likable character not even a villain we might admire for hisher chutzpah Secondly all the acting is awful even from veteran Willem DaFoe The ham is so plentiful here you feel like youre at a picnic but one of those wretched company employee picnics where you drink too much cheap beer and get your hangover before you even stop drinking Then you eat an underdone hotdog and throw upAll right Im being a little rough on a young director who might still go places as I said the camera work is quite goodBut I feel cheated the blurb for this film suggests we will get to watch a Modern western and the DVD packaging has pictures on it that suggest this as well but nobody actually connected to the films making seems to know that this is the kind of film theyre supposed to be makingThat betrayal is what hurts but even without it the fact remains that we dont like these characters we feel embarrassed for the actors the story is hopelessly muddled and in the last analysis we just dont careI took it out of the DVD player about half way through but the rental store wouldnt give me my money backNow that really hurts,0
What has hurt this film is everyone and their Aunt Matilda is comparing it to its illustrious predecessor which is always going to hurt any show If you take it as a western its a darned good show We discover how our characters in Lonesome Dove wind up in the situations they start up in Such as Why do two Texas Rangers who live on adventure wind up in a dead town And how did Gus manage to lose the love of his life The performances are very good and we see the exact same mannerisms the characters will have down the road The actors did a very good job The cinematography was superb and while the music didnt live up to the legendary score of nearly two decades past that was an impossible task and it was still fineIt also helped that we had three episodes which you just dont see in a miniseries anymore Heck its downright impossible to see a two part telefilm these daysFans of the western rejoice,1
I went into this film expecting it to be similar to The Matrix or Pi Boy was I wrong Yes there is a poorly written poorly acted plot in the movie with CG animated cells and peptides to boot However the real focus of the film are the expert talking heads spewing out new age feelgood hogwash in between plot segmentsSure it stars off innocently enough There is a little bit of real quantum physics in the beginning It states for example that electrons exist as both particle and wave and that an atom is mostly empty space However the movie takes a giant and unscientific leap saying that subatomic quantum effects happen on large scales as well The talking heads take it even further According to them the following are trueWhen Columbus arrived in the Caribbean the natives were unable to see his ships because their minds were incapable of perceiving something so different Meditation can reduce the murder rate With positive thought you can walk on water Your thoughts can change the formations of ice crystals in bottles of waterAnd hey thats only in the first 40 minutesWatching the movie was torture This film felt like a movie they would show you to get you to join a cult After doing my homework I realized that it basically is just thatOn the other hand this could be seen as a campy comedy albeit one thats not funnySave your time and money dont see this movie,0
Overall this movie is dreadful and should have never been made One of the problems with this movie is that there is no link to the audience and the characters for example if she is about to be attacked you want to feel Oh My God No but you dont in this case you dont care because there is no link that has been made to know the character In the trailer it seemed as though the movie would be great yet there is no suspense what so ever really There could have been maybe some mystery but there is not All she has is a toolbox was said on the DVDs back you would think that it was carefully planned this movie and cleverly made but it is not The ending was just awful very straight forward and pointless too The acting is either average or below average maybe even lower In my opinion it was a waste of an hour of my life The Special Effects and sets were average too nothing special what so ever There is not much gore or bloody violence not much blood is shown This movie was advertised to make it sound quite amazing yet really its not even worth looking for I do not recommend this to anyone unless they are easily satisfied by a few fights and a boring story,0
Textbook example of an underestimated movieAlthough one can watch this movie over and over again and laugh every single time and still see something new in it its still regarded as just another funny picture And although the movie has inspired many and added its quotes and images to the pyche of all its viewers Moon Over Parador still hasnt received the acclaim it should Even the brilliant cast with Academy Award winner Richard Dreyfuss and Raul Julia to mention one is not able to change this perceptionBut after watching Raul Julia as Roberto Strausmann make Richard Dreyfus an offer he cant refuse in a meatlocker by reading him a good review of a part that he once played one can only come to one conclusion this stuff is timeless In fifty years we will have the proof,1
Especially after watching THE MATRIX RELOADED SPOILERSAfter seeing the Matrix with all its ridiculous fantasy makebelieverobotic characters with their super powers it was refreshing to see an action movie with real people in situations that involved actual risk I cared about these people and even though some of the stunts seemed a bit much it still left me feeling like its possible verses what a stupid video game like the MatrixThis movie isnt brain surgery its very straight forward Some things are predictable like knowing that someone is going to be a backstabber and that someone early on is going to die Pretty obvious but SO WHAT The first 15 minutes sets up our reason our motive our main objectiveI like that Theron and Walhberg didnt have any makeout scenes I am glad that they didnt go there They kept it about funny dialogue ESPECIALLY SETH GREENE That guy IS FUNNYThis is a movie that I would buy when it comes out on DVD Its fun fast and entertaining The only thing and I guess its a big thing is that we are really rooting for the bad guys This group of protaganists are already on the wrong side of the law Not a good message for the kiddies parents please explain this to them,1
A multimillionaire marries a female doctor He hasnt worked in a day and she is devoted to her profession He sees her off each day Something has got to giveOur hero Henry Fonda finally decides to do something with his life He becomes a salesman in a department store but is soon fired as poorer people need the job In the meantime Dr Helen Hunt Barbara Stanwyck has given up her practice Whats there to doKirk Fonda buys a bankrupt hospital and the two shall now be happy aiding others while they eke out an existenceWhats with the writing here When annoyed with her husband Dr Hunt says Youve been acting like gestapo This is supposed to be a comedy Hogwash A very boring tedious film Very little going on here,0
I just have to say that this was the third worst movie I have ever seen right after the attack of the murder tomatos 3 and starship troopers 2 It wasnt just dialogs or the paper walls or even the guns shots which just automagically disappeared with no holes in the walls It was the horrible acting No wonder that I have never seen these actors before they all probably slept with the directors I think iam being nice to this movie now but that is only because iam to tired from screaming at the movie just saw it My advice is to buy as many DVDs of this movie as you possibly can and burn it so no one ever can see this horrible waste of time money and film ever again,0
I once had a conversation with my parents who told me British cinema goers in the 1940s and 50s would check to see a films country of origin before going to see it It didnt matter what the plot was or who was in it if it was an American movie people would want to see it and if it was British people wouldnt want to see it This might sound like a ridiculous generalisation but after seeing THE ASTONISHED HEART I can understand why people in those days preferred American cinema to the home grown variety Back in the 1940s British equity was devoid of working class members and it shows in this movie Everyone speaks in an English lad dee daa upper class accent that makes the British Royal Family sound like working class scum and what this does is alienate a large amount of a potential British audience who would no doubt prefer to be watching Jimmy Cagney in WHITE HEAT because people would have If not related to then certainly empathised with a violent gangster in cinematic terms more than some high class English shrink in 1949 Thats entertainment the reason people go to cinemas Even the characters names seem bizarre Leonora How many British people were named Leonora in 1949 And the protagonists drink cocktails And they use words like Austere You do get the feeling that this wasnt marketed for a 1949 mainstream British audience But why should it if the majority of British cinema goers were queuing up at cinemas to watch far more entertaining American imports Watching THE ATSONISHED HEART in 2005 I was astonished how dated everything was in fact its so dated I thought maybe it might be a spoof from THE HARRY ENDFIELD SHOW What didnt astonish me was the fact that these types of movie came close to sinking the British film industry an industry that didnt pick up until American money invested in crowd pleasers like ZULU ALFIE and the James Bond movies,0
Christmas In Connecticut is a gem of a Christmas movie classic While lesser known than some others it is nonetheless a delightful way to spend an evening at holiday time I watch it every yearBarbara Stanwyck is perfectly cast as Elizabeth Lane the single career girl Way before it was popular Stanwyck embodies the single girl on the rise Her NYC apartment and her friendly uncle restaurateur around the corner typify the single girl in the city existence She cant cook yet she writes a homemaking column for a magazineDennis Morgan is also perfectly cast as our wartime hero Jefferson Jones who wants to meet the amazing Elizabeth Lane After being lost at sea all he wants is to spend Christmas in a real home Which sets up the delightful madcap story that evolves It is fun from beginning to end We should all have an Uncle Felix too,1
I just saw this film last night at Toronto Film Festival where it was playing under the Midnight Madness section To tell you the truth the only reason why I went for this movie was because it shared its name with the Radiohead song and also because my friend had bought the tickets so I really didnt have a choice D I went in expecting it to be something like The Silence of the Lambs but it turned out to be semigore flick Somebody has already mentioned that none of the characters are likable and that is absolutely correct I really couldnt care less if Potentes character got her entrails ripped out by the Creep I was rooting for the homeless to make it out alive with Potentes character getting her just desserts Christopher Smith has certainly done a great job with the visual aspect of the film However the story is rather weak but then again the whole point of the movie was to scare the crap out of you and it did that quite effectively The score by a Bristol band called The Insects was top notch That more than anything else really scared the crap out of meThe director was a really decent chap and was quite entertaining during the QA session I really do hope he gets to make better films in the futureThis one is strictly for genre fans but Id recommend nonfans to give this a try anyway It was a fun ride,1
This is one of the best movies to come from Bollywood in years Certainly the best this year until now Indian to the core the panoramic visuals the heartpleasing dialogs and the melodious and soft music make the movie an exceptional one The apt depiction of Indianvalues and culture makes the viewer search for hisher roots in them and invigorates the mind and spirit with a sense of pride and a new lease on lifeThis movie is for viewers who enjoy a call to their imagination and philosophical senses If you like watching movies to get all your nerves excited through onscreen action sex or terror then this movie is not for you because you will find that the movie is not full of 90 degrees twists in it It is as simple a story for a movie as it can get But thats exactly where the art of the movie lies One gets a real life experience and the best thing is this experience is one full of values and hope It is about the positive side of life about the sweet things that God has showered on humans as against the regressive movies that insist on showing dons terrorists and underworlds This is not about things and people that have gone bad It is about the goodness that still persists and that keeps the world running Of course every genre of movies is respectable but it takes a lot of courage and talent to come up with a movie that swims against the current and tries to open the eyes of the public to the hidden realities and truths Having said that heres more The movie is the journey of a couple from their engagement to their arranged marriage yes thats right it is an arranged marriage and the couple come to know each other only through their parents and learn to love each other The 6 month gap between engagement and marriage is a long time not full of enticing happenings but one that nurtures the growing love and devotion of the couple to each other They learn together the importance of their relationship and of this invaluable period of their lives and work to strengthen the bonds of marriage But have these been strengthened enough Their relationship will face the test of not only time but also fortune Will they pass this test That is what Vivah is about,1
I recently viewed Manufactured Landscapes at the Seattle International Film Festival I was drawn to the movie as a photographer because Im both familiar and a fan of Burtynskys work While I believe the movie does a good job getting its message across I couldnt help but feel that it was made as a complete afterthought to the photographs and subsequent popular book by Burtynsky Obviously one reason for this is the extensive use of still photographs featuring zooms and pans across them While this is a good effect when used economically I felt like 75 of the movie was just stills from Burtynskys book which I already own Thats probably an exaggeration but thats how I felt If you own the book or are familiar with his work you might be better off skipping this one,0
Theres no use trying to describe in detail the convoluted overly melodramatic plot involving Civil War bitterness a crooked town boss and other complications Its all badStella Stevens Andrew Prine Bo Svenson William Smith Tim Thomerson and Lee Majors are all good actors that may not be big stars or big stars anymore but always made fun moviesHere theyre all wasted on a picture that looks like it was shot in a wild west tourist trap with costumes borrowed from the local high school theater department In fact most of the acting appears to be on the high school level too which might not be so bad if it werent so pretentiousThe name of Ed Wood is invoked way too lightly these days I think in this case the comparison is warranted However I suspect that old Ed would have made a more entertaining western than this,0
This was a great movie but it had the worst ending I think I have ever seen The actors were great and displayed wonderful talent The entire story was twisted and unexpecting which is what made it entertaining As good as the movie was the entire film is judged by the ending which was terrible Maybe a sequel could eliminate this bad ending,1
Great artists always suffered while they were young I could mention Mozart and Beethoven but that is not the point This movie was made by HG Clouzot whose family wanted him to succeed in the Law professionsIts main star is Louis Jouvet who studied and practiced as as pharmacist before becoming The Greatest Actor and also director of Frances Theater before and after WWIIThey both had health problems Clouzot had TB while young Jouvet had cardiac problems and died on a theaterSuch events shape the character of men and women of course One might even say that todays Artists are so poor because they had never suffered and fought for their livesTo me this is the greatest of Clouzots movies Wages of Fear is greater in suspense Diabolique also has more suspense and a better plot and is more about female evilQuai des Orfvres is more human Clouzot was falsely accused by De Gaulles entourage mostly communists and Jews of collaboration with the Nazis and banned from making films until until De Gaulle left Frances Government in early 1946 De Gaulle came back in 1958 as PresidentThe main characters are all good souls Jenny LAmour may perform as a putain on stage but she is not a whore dictionaires make synonyms of those words but they are not the same loves her husband and refuses the slight advances from her presumably Lesbian friend Dora the photographerMaurice the husband is jealous and timid but runs away from the scene of the crime He is a coward because he fell in love with a woman and traded an eventually more upscale career for loveAntoine the detective interpreted by the great Louis Jouvet basically a stage actor performs in this French Gray not Noir as well as EG Robinson in Double Indemnity shows flair for pseudo criminals tenderness for a Negro son and compassion for the true author of the crime because he remembers that is father cleaned the latrines at some noblemans chteauClouzot was capable of slapping an actors face in order to put him in the right frame of mind but deep inside he was very human I have his horoscope in front of me He had Venus in Sagittarius which means openheartedness devotion charity and altruism For those who do not believe in Astrology my most sincere apologies,1
Sublimity is the way we have to reach for The Beauty And sublimity is the stuff this film is made of If not his best its my most loved of all Bogdanovich moviesThis unique masterpiece remind us as most of the other films from the director what life is or should be about love lost or failure and hope and faith and charity As the song from whom the films takes its title Gershwins well known composition the film makes the impossible true and tries to make us aware that noone is able to judge anybody all this with the lightness of a comedy and the timing of a masterful direction the first ten minutes with the detectives following the ladies almost without a line of dialogue constructed upon the looks and views of the characters with that Bogdanovich touch based on the pointofview is a class on Cinema Language something that PB learned well from his admired directors from the Golden Age of the Movies With a superb cast and a glorious soundtrack including the best of Sinatras Trilogy this movie full of selfconsciousness and compassion and far away from selfindulgence and emptiness as some critics wrote deserves a better place on the History of American Cinema than where it have been placed Its not long on style short on substance it is complex in its simplicity and beautiful absolutely beautiful,1
Although it doesnt seem very promising for a long stretch Renoirs French Cancan ends up being an effortlessly charming film The story is clich a laundry girl Nini Franoise Arnoul is discovered by a night club owner Danglard Jean Gabin Danglard steals her from her baker boyfriend and drops his current girlfriend both of whom come back for their former lovers Nini has to choose whether to go back to her humble life with the baker go on with the show with her employer oh or become a princess as a prince falls in love with her at one point too Im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have The film ends with the opening of Danglards new night club the Moulin Rouge and a couple of gorgeous song and dance numbers The first of them Complainte de la Butte which also provides the base of most of the films musical score is simply one of the most gorgeous songs ever written and Renoir himself wrote it If youre a fan of Baz Luhrmanns 2001 film Moulin Rouge youll recognize the tune as it comes up near the beginning of that film sung by Rufus Wainwright Although it isnt very prominent in that film everyone I know who owns the soundtrack loves it In addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written French Cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen Its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 810,1
Not long enough to be feature length and not abrupt enough to a short this thing exists for one reason to have a lesbian threeway There are worse reasons to exist One sad thing is that this could have made a decent feature length movie Misty fits snuggly into her outfit and is a very cocky girl and when people are so infatuated with a game character like Lara Croft that they make nude calenders of her you know that a softcore flick is set to explode Unfortunately this is pretty pathetic Especially the painfully fake sex scene between Darian and Misty where you can see her hand is fingering air Watch this if you just cant get enough of Misty or Ruby who makes a nice blonde and has zee verst jerman akcent ever,0
The movie was excellent save for some of the scenes with Esposito I enjoyed how it brought together every detective on the series and wrapped up some plotlines that were never resolved during the series thanks to NBC It was great to see Pembleton and Bayliss together at their most human and most basic persons Braugher and Secor did a great job but as usual will get overlooked It hurt to see that this was the end of Homicide Memories tapes and reruns on CourtTV just arent the same as watching it come on every Friday But the movie did its job and did it very well presenting a great depiction of life after Al retired and the family relationship that existed between the unit I enjoyed this a lot,1
Yes Bam cried a couple times and so did Englund And most probably you will too The whole cast is back in action and Knoxville has stepped up to become the true leader of this gang of messedup retards I mean this in the best possible way I first thought maybe Bam or SteveO were the main goto guysnope the main man is now Johnny Dont get me wrong everybody and I mean everybody is great in this flick Right from the getgo youre laughing and believe you me dont plan on resting that smile of yours I personally think the movie definitely has better moments than the first You know when you go into a theater and you kind of dont want to have high expectations for itwell this movie blows all expectations away If you love Jackass you can go into this with gigantic expectations No matter what youll laugh your ass off If youre not laughing the reason is most likely someone has a gun in your face telling you if you laugh you die or maybe you are embarrassed about the sound of your laugh or the highest probability is that you were eating Jack Sht for breakfast and Jack left town All I have to say is prepare yourself to have a sore face after the movie,1
This movie did attempt to capture the naive idealism that many young teenaged girls have for fun friendship escape danger sex maturity etc The problem was that it failed to establish these things on every single level which is why it failed to build a decent story around them I couldnt follow the point of any part of this story nor any reason why I should careThis movie is not an exploration into pedophilia at all Its basically about a girl being in love with her sister and her sister being in love with the idea of men While the latter tries out her love of men the former tries to win her sister back by getting evenThe plot is weak the characters are weak and the reality of it all was similar to an amateur porn filmmaker without the sexual substance,0
This film took me by surprise I make it a habit of finding out as little as possible about films before attending because trailers and reviews provide spoiler after spoiler All I knew upon entering the theater is that it was a documentary about a long married couple and that IMDb readers gave it a 78 Rotten Tomatoes users ranked it at 79 and the critics averaged an amazing 82 If anything they UNDERRATED this little gemFilmmaker Doug Block decided to record his parents for posterity and at the beginning of the film we are treated to the requisite interviews with his parents outspoken mother Mina and less than forthcoming dad Mike I immediately found this couple interesting and had no idea where the filmmaker Mike Minas son Doug was going to take us As a matter of fact I doubt that Doug himself knew where he was going with thisLife takes unexpected twists and turns and this beautifully expressive film follows the journey It is difficult to verbalize just how moved I was with this story and the unique way in which it was told Absolutely riveting from beginning to end and it really is a mustsee even if you arent a fan of the documentary genre This film will make you think of your own life and might even evoke memories that you thought were long forgotten 51 Birch Street is one of those rare filmgoing experiences that makes a deep impression and never leaves you The best news of all is that HBO had a hand in the production so instead of playing to a limited art house audience eventually millions of people will have a chance to view this incredible piece of work BRAVO,1
Why this is called Mistresses is a puzzle because its about four women three of whom arent mistresses Except wait Ah I see Its a salacious title and we all have to merchandise I suppose The series itself Delicious Most of the characters are hell bent on cutting metaphorical chunks off themselves Great fun Reminds me of LWTs 1976 miniseries Bouquet of Barbed Wire where every character and their dads wielded the macheteSiobhan Orla Brady is the only actual mistress and shes getting herself in proper trouble Husband is infertile So no chance of a baby there then But at work theres Dominic played by ubersexy Adam Rayner who looks so good that theres no surprise when heavy lust breaks out Dominic it turns out has no fertility problems I expect his sperms do swashbuckling probably each carries a little sword and now Siobhan is inevitably pregnant that way instead What Siobhan should do is to shut up good and tight and go with its a miracle What she actually does of course is say to her friends I have to tell my husband No you dont Really you dont Stop StopKatie Sarah Parish was a mistress once for we learn that shed had an affair with a married man before the series started Unwisely shes now taken up with his son The father died of cancer and Katie who is a doctor helped him on his journey So shes an euthanasiarist has had affairs with two of her patients and is sleeping with the son of the father in carelessly ignoring the incestuous undertones Its not going to end well for KatieJessica is an experimental lesbian She arranges events and shes busy doing a lesbian marriage as the series gets underway She quickly gets into steamy eye exchanges with one of the brides Alex played by Anna Torv and the script hurries along to a lesbonk with great haste However it cant think of a good way of putting the two women in bed together so it invents a very lame Youre not having a hen night Well I cant let you get away with that Ill organise one and the guests shall be Me which achieves the result but isnt exactly Winterson I thought script writers were supposed to earn their living Lazy Torvs interpretation of her character is good Alex treats Jessica as possibly unsavoury and Alexs body language always points backwards when shes moving forward Mind once shes over the wall in she happily goes and unsurprisingly for Shelley Conn is so mouthwatering that so would a good percentage of the human race given the chanceWhich brings us to Trudi whos a widow Of course there should be plain people in a community but if youre going to have a plain character then you have to invent something to admire in them Its quite possible to be a lump and engaging However Smalls Trudi looks like one of those characters that Casting put prominently in a medieval crowd scene after the director said Thats ridiculous not every single character would be pretty More tellingly you cant find anything to admire in her Nothing Shes a turnip in a bowl of apples Appallingly she does sexy from time to time I wont forget her appearance in bright red corset with stockings tucked into her crotch for a long time and for all the wrong reasonsSo good delinquent fun all round Theres easily enough material here for a second series and I hope that they do one I trust they learn one lesson though The characters never take off their underclothes in bed Having spent abandoned hours of unbridled lust afterwards they surface still wearing their bras or keep the sheets tight wound round their naughty bits After several episodes no nipples yet and you can go beg for a cock Whats this Early 21st century puritanism So production team are you listening Your characters will solve some of their mental problems if they Do abandon as well as Talk it At least theyll have more fun in the fun scenes poor things In a series dominated by either being in the bedroom or wanted to be in the bedroom or having just been in the bedroom its a bit silly and jars a lot that the characters bonk in their underwearOverall I was going to score 6 top end medium but the series does one trick thats rare enough When each episode ends you always want more and you look forward to the next one with anticipation So I score 7,1
This movie was marketed extremely well When it was released in 97 during the middle of Master Ps fame and success anything and everything with his name on it was selling off the shelves Thats why its no wonder this underground urban drama sold over 250000 copies and still goinIf you are a fan of No Limit back then or even now check it out It has a few old school phatty videos and dont get me started with the freaky deaky strippers at the bonus Ice Cream Party So what I got to say to all the people who dont like Master P or No Limit Records dont watch it because it isnt for you and dont bother voting on it because youre only going to deter TRU no limit fans from renting or purchasing this video with your low votes,1
Its boggles the mind how this movie was nominated for seven Oscars and won one Not because its abysmal or because given the collective credentials of the creative team behind it really ought to deserve them but because in every category it was nominated Prizzis Honor disappoints Some would argue that old Hollywood pioneer John Huston had lost it by this point in his career but I dont buy it Only the previous year he signed the superb UNDER THE VOLCANO a dark character study set in Mexico that ranks among the finest he ever did Prizzis Honor on the other hand a film loaded with star power good intentions and a decent script proves to be a major letdownThe overall tone and plot of a gangster falling in love with a female hitman prefigures the quirky crimedies that caught Hollywood by storm in the early 90s but the script is too convoluted for its own sake the motivations are off and on the whole the story seems unsure of what exactly its trying to be a romantic comedy a crime drama a gangster saga etc Jack Nicholson doing a Brooklyn accent that works perfectly for De Niro but sounds unconvincing coming from Jack and Kathleen Turner in the leading roles seem to be in paycheck mode just going through the motions almost sleepwalking their way through some parts Anjelica Huston on the other hand fares better but her performance is sabotaged by her characters motivations she starts out the victim of her bigot fathers disdain she proves to be supportive to her exhusband then becomes a vindictive bitch that wants his head on a plateThe colours of the movie have a washedup quality like it was made in the early 70s and Hustons direction is as uninteresting as everything else Theres promise behind the story and perhaps in the hands of a director hungry to be recognized it couldve been morphed to something better but whats left looks like a film nobody was really interested in making,0
I was just watching a Forensic Files marathon on Court TV The episode was identical to the plot of this movie right down to the incest secret and the affairwiththesister subplot I dont recall any Based on a True Story disclaimer but the case does have MOW written all over it Apparently it chronicles the real homicide of Ruby Morris by her husband Earl sentenced to 25 years to life for her murder Just goes to show you truth can be stranger than fiction because I thought the Lifetime plot was contrived and a more than a stretch insofar as believability goes Im with the other posters who said the acting was bad I didnt notice it with all of the players though It was really the lead character the daughter whose performance was bad,0
Its actually a good thing Sean Connery retired as James Bond as Im sure he wouldnt be able to keep up in the nowadays spyingbusiness where fast cars have been replaced with hitech brainwashing techniques and gorgeous women are considered to be less sexy than advanced computer equipment Cypher is a pretty inventive SciFi thriller that often evokes feelings of fright claustrophobia despite being utterly implausible You know the trend in these types of movies nothing is what it seems and just when you think figured out the convoluted plot the writers make sure to insert a new twist that confuses everyone again The events in Cypher supposedly take place in the most prominent regions of the computer world where the major companies dont really do a lot apart from trying to steal each others thunder Company Digisoft literally spends millions brainwashing people and providing them with a new identity only to let them infiltrate as spies in their biggest competitor the Sunways Corporation Sunways on the other hand constantly tries to unmask the Digisoftrats and recruit them again as doublespies In between this whole unprofitable business stands Morgan Sullivan a seemingly colorless thirtysomething employee whos been selected by Sebastian Rooks the berspy to diddle the secret policies of BOTH companies Trust me its actually less complicated than it sounds and director Vincenzo Natali the dude from Tube carefully takes his time to introduce all the important and less important characters The first half of the film is rather reminiscent to the sadly underrated John Frankenheimer gem Seconds starring Rock Hudson as it also deals with erasing identities and drastically altering your former life style Even the set pieces seem to come straight out of that 60s film with loads of empty white rooms and eerie corridors that seem to be endless Theres also plenty of great action and suspense most notably when Morgan soberly experiences how the Digisoft crew inspects the results of their brainwashingtechniques during boring conventions The middle section of the film drags a little mainly because you already realize that its all just building up towards multiple misleading plottwists and I hoped for a slightly more grim portrayal of the notsodistant future Jeremy Northam is perfectly cast and the adorable Lucy Liu is convincingly mysterious as the foxy lady who appears to be on his side Regular directors choice David Hewlett has the most memorable supportive role as the uncannily eccentric Suways engineer Virgil C Dunn Cypher is well made and adrenalin rushing SciFi entertainment highly recommended to people who fully like to use their brain capacity from time to time,1
I happened upon this movie as an 810 year old on a cold dark November afternoon I was outside playing all day freezing and when I came in around 4pm I had a cup of hot cocoa and sat down in front of the TV with a blanket I was surprised to be watching a cartoon that wasnt all happy and sillyand was in fact dark and moralistic It captured my imagination Im sure it misses the text and is abbreviated in all the wrong places for the Tolkien purist But it still captures the spirit of the story the choice to carry a burden for the good of others the consequences of selfish rash decisions etc The quality of animation leaves room for complaint But the one place where this movie clearly rises above the new films is the voice characterizations John Hurt is great in this If you dont like how the character is drawn look away and just listen to him His voice is extraordinary Ive seen it again many many times and it always brings me back to that time as a kid thirsty for some magical adventure Its for this reason I say lucky the film is nostalgic for me so I overlook its shortcomings But between John Hurt and Tolkiens fantasy it still reached me and still does,1
My only regret is that one cannot grade a movie on IMDb with a 0 A Cena would definitely deserve that At LEASTSPOILER The movie starts with a bunch of people entering a crypt to awaken an ancient Vampire When a guy cuts himself and his blood drips and falls onto the putrid and dried corpse that is supposed to be a bloodsucker the metamorphosis takes place and the Vampire in an ANIMATIONlike effect would you believe it quickly takes on a more human formonly to reveal that hes wearing a tux and a bowtie A BOWTIE yes Red if my memory serves me right I tried to check out random scenes by skipping through a bit but it did not get any better than the opening sequences Thats the point when I turned the movie off cursing it for having made me hope to see a Vampire movie This is surely not oneunless youre 5 and could take such stupidity seriouslySo if you like Vampires and dont want to feel revolted or even disgustedlearn from my mistake and dont even try to see this garbage,0
Its been a while since seeing this the first time so I watched it again with the second movie in the series While I realize there is a 3rd movie out that I havent seen yet Ill review under the original titleJust from the standpoint of production value screen writing and movie making this movie fails on many levels though it succeeds on a few as well What can you expect from a lowbudget B movie Not much and it works from the standpoint of production However the writing is certainly disjointed with little in the way of character developmentexactly what Id expect when there is an agenda to a film I didnt have a problem with the actingthe cast is solid however the screenplay in both movies gives the actors little opportunity to really stretch themselves Because the film is Christian this is predictable as you cant very well portray violent chaos of the end times without also breaking some of the ethics which are normally associated with Christianity In other words the mistake comes in making this into a Grated film when the content even in the most conservative of Bible interpretations would be Rrated by any measure So if the purpose of the movie is to scare people into Christian faith then the movie should be somewhat scary right However you cant comment on a film adaptation from a book without commenting on the book or in this case series of books There are certainly plenty of Christian materials worthy enough to be made into moviesbut not the Left Behind seriesand these movies ultimately fail because while being bestsellers they are poorly written novels based on bad theologyAs a Southern Baptist minister I confess that the books were a guilty pleasure for me though I have yet to finish the last two books of the series I have described them as decent fiction and if the books would take the point of view that this is one possibility or interpretation of the subject of biblical eschatology study of the end times then I could live with that However this series is divisive in Christian circles because it promotes the literalist interpretation of all Scripture above a more proper hermeneutic Inevitably this leads to the pretrib premillenial dispensation point of view which confines an allpowerful God far too by humanitys world In other words as Ive always said God shouldnt need our helicopters and bombs to do his ultimate work But because many people particularly unstudied Christians cant think beyond their own worldviews we are left with a proconservative fundamentalist stance with regard to Bible interpretation and attempts to push it through as the only interpretationThus the books carry with them an agenda not so much to get the lost to understand their need for Christ but to state that the fundamentalist point of view is the only valid way to understand the Bible I recall very clearly reading several years ago in the second novel a scene where the characters reference a person who was left behind BECAUSE of his nonadherence to this point of view as if real christians worthy to be raptured couldnt possibly hold to another eschatology This is disturbing for several reasons the least of which is because a rapture is only briefly mentioned in Scripture and its connection to real endtime prophecy is tenuous at bestBut the real issue with these books is comes in the way they divide the Christian community and how they portray true Christian behavior Ultimately I feel they harden more people to an otherwise legitimate faithreligion instead of win people towards it It turns all Christians into caricatures equally disdained and laughed at by the world despite the fact that there is theological room for a wide diversity of believes within Christian thought and practice As a Christian body on the whole weve done enough of that kind of damage to society over 2000 years of historyand we certainly dont need to promote it by film to thousands maybe millions of othersThus the Left Behind movies fail because the Left Behind books arent worthy to be interpreted into movies,0
I tried Lord help me how I tried But there are just some people almost incapable of creating quality Brett Ratner Uwe Boll Britney Spears and Asylum To their credit The 911 Commission Report seems like an honest attempt by the company to advance into a more sophisticated state of storytelling and movie making But for all intents and purposes it comes off as another truly film in their gallery At the opening the disclaimer notifies audiences that all the names have been changed but the names of the terrorists remain relatively the same A man named Mussaui attempts to learn how to fly a plane With a stone cold grimace that would instantly make anyone uneasy this undercover agent is able to learn how to fly on a small computer And you have to wonder not how he was able to get into this program so easily but on how these people didnt even ask questions because this scene is so farfetched in its presentation and the actor playing this man is extremely over the top And you can see that director Scott attempts to mimic Paul Greengrass with a bright grainy photography thats followed by an awfully dizzying and irritating handheld direction that throughout the entire film attempts to take off from Greengrasss gungho guerrilla filmmaking techniques You can sense Scott emulating Greengrasss technique for realism but it becomes rather lamebrained halfway in Meanwhile the film comes off less a Traffic take off and more a take off on Law Order in which well have the disclaimer notifying us the names have been changed the logo almost reminiscent of the Law Order logo and then ninety minutes of the actors pumping their chests and discussing politicsNeither of which are ever as compelling as it tries to be And then when the film seems as if its attempting to be an adult drama Scott relies on his old failsafe the sex scene Scotts new film looks like it really wants to be thought of as a low budget Munich but its not and it manages to be underwhelming on every such occasion possible The 911 Commission Report falls flat and thats because its limited in its attempts to imitate other filmsWhile I appreciate the ambition inherent behind the camera this new perspective of the events leading up to 911 is flat and dull Hard as it may try to be a lowbudget Munich its only really as entertaining as a normal Dolph Lundgren film youd find on Cinemax,0
Anand is one of those lowbudget but well taken movies Its a cup of coffee entertainment with no violence blood or jump out of your seat excitement which most telugu films have However it does have some massala of its own Roopa is a headstrong and downtoearth young woman who is not afraid to confront any sort of situation even her offensive motherinlaws distaste for her She even backs out of the wedding because her fianc doesnt stand up for her However her air of confidence and independence is enough to make Anand a rich young gentleman living in the city aspire to be her new husband His father accidentally kills her parents in a car crash anyways so why not pay her back But Roopa is not the kind who will fall for charming smiles and polite behavior she puts him through a bunch of situations continuing to be rude and a pain Its not until he stands up for her and saves her life that she understands she loves him too But complications ensue,1
Yes the plot is predictable yes there are a few plot holes yes it has a madeforTV quality and yes Britney Spears wrote the book with obvious selfpromotionBut forget all of that this movie is funFun in an After School Special sortofway but fun neverthelessVirginia Madsen as the mother does a great job so good that Im going to start watching for her movies She reminded me of Diane Lane for all the good reasonsThe rest of the cast does a fine job too If I was a casting agent Id be scouting some of these young actorsThe production values are above usual TV standards and the music was really great better than several bigbudget movies Ive seenIf youre in the mood for German noir this movie isnt for you If you want a safe fun and underrated movie this is a good one Its one you could show to your 10 year old daughter but enjoy it yourself too,1
really excellent movie one of the best ive seen Touching and simple just like life sometimes you cry sometimes you laugh and its just beautiful not too much of anything just as its suppose to be Really loved the idea of the movie noone is bad or good all or just people sometimes make mistakes mostly because of societys pressure everyone tries to stay strong and some succeed more than others and the most important thing is that you dont have reasons to get angry you can do it but eventually the anger goes away and then you to need to let love come back in although its hard there lies the true happinessGreat actors and cast the movie really gets you into the feeling of the movienice nice niceI recommend to see it especially if you like to see italians life,1
All i hear about is how poorly the animation is done It may not be up to par with what everyone expects but look at it this way Would you expect perfection in hell It is my belief that the animation was made dry and gritty on purpose It was great to see her character transformation in this movie considering it will probably be as close to live action as we will ever get I hope for a sequel very soon If we want live action i think we may be better off with Chastity or Purgatori I dont think Lady Death would transfer well to film But be that as it may It is my own personal belief that all the naysayers about this movie are DEAD wrong No pun intended,1
I very nearly walked out but Id paid my money and my nearlyasdisgusted friend wanted to hold out After the endearing wideeyed innocence of A New Hope and the thrilling sophistication of The Empire Strikes Back I remember awaiting Return of the Jedi with almost aching anticipation But from the opening scene of this insultingly commercial sewage I was bitterly disappointed and enraged at Lucas He should have been ashamed of himself but this abomination undeniably proves that he doesnt have subatomic particle of shame in his cold greedy heart Episode I would go on to reinforce this fact your honor I call Jarjar Binks but please issue barf bags to the members of the jury firstFrom the initial raising of the gate at Jabbas lair this film was nothing more than a twoplushour commercial for as many licensable profitmaking action figures as Lucas could cram into it the piglike guards the hokey fleshpigtailed flunky that vile muppetpet of Jabbas the new and recycled cabaret figures the monsters etc etc ad vomitum Then there were the detestably cute and marketable Ewoks Pile on top of that all of the rebel alliance aliens Fifteen seconds each onscreen or less and the kiddies just GOTTA have one for their collection The blatant exploitative financial baiting of children is nauseatingLucas didnt even bother to come up with a new plot he just exhumed the Death Star from A New Hope and heaved in a boatload of cheap sentiment What an appalling slap in the face to his fans I cant shake the notion that Lucas took a perverse pleasure in inflicting this dreck on his fans Ive got these lemmings hooked so bad that I can crank out the worst piece of stinking putrid garbage that I could dream up and theyll flock to the theaters to scarf it up Plus all the kiddies will whine and torture their parents until they buy the brats a complete collection of action figures of every single incidental undeveloped cartoonish caricature that I stuffed in and I get a cut from every single one Itll make me even more obscenely richThere may have been a paltry partial handful of redeeming moments in this miserable ripoff I seem to recall that Harrison Ford managed to just barely keep his nose above the surface of this cesspool But whatever tiny few bright spots there may be are massively obliterated by the offensive commercialism that Lucas so avariciously embraced in this total absolute sellout to profit,0
I got this for my birthday in a box set under the name Broke Skull Well after watching one on the DVD and being pleasantly surprised I popped this sucker in It was worse than I had expected and I didnt expect much This movie is basically a convoluted story about a guy who dies and comes back to life with the mob and other bull crap There was some interesting ideas in this that were never followed up on Now everybody has been saying there was a lot of gore can somebody tell me were I saw a bad effect of a head being crushed brain tissue or something and blood coming from the penis area two times I have to say the the part were the guy gets his man hood bitten off made me squirm that was the only good thing about this movie And that gay sex scene was just thrown in there for no reason The acting in this was Atrocious really it blew That Asian chick was annoying then the annoying Mexican boyfriend who comes in to just be killed I say if you get this in a box set that is fine but dont spend any money on it at all,0
Who the heck is responsible for this terrible mangling of one of my favorite books This is just terrible terrible acting terrible script The story isnt even close to its old self and what were they thinking Robin Williams for Goshs sake This really defies description Dont see this Seriously dont Not even for laughs Especially not if youre a fan of the book This might just be the worst movie adaptation ever everything is disjointed and scrambled the characters which are important in order to understand the sequence of events are seriously marginalized and every potentially interesting location from the book has been changed example Vienna New York into something profoundly uninterestingFor those who havent read the book its basically a fictional biography about a writer growing up exploring his writing and so on His mother writes an autobiography which is hailed despite her protests as a sort of feminist manifesto The book is wellwritten engaging and long Its prose is simply beautifulThis movie on the other hand is about Robin Williams once again telling us to seize the day,0
This was surely the stupidest crudest most repulsive film I have seen in quite some time I was tempted to turn off the VCR but as in the fascination watching a horrible car accident I literally found it COMPULSIVELY HATEABLE in every conceivable way and slugged it out through to the end I am by no means a prude who objects to the comedic portrayal of sexual antics on the screen Animal House Porkys Theres Something About Mary both American Pie movies and even the notorious Freddy Got Fingered I have found highly enjoyable on their own crude terms Mamie Van Dorens breastbaring sponge bath is the most horrifying appearance by a naked geriatric since The Shining Ineptly edited and shot with incredibly annoying performances from Devon Sawa and Jason Schwartzman the film ended without the benefit of having made me giggle once The only useful purpose for the film is as a textbook example of how not to make a gross out picture Oh and it would also serve nicely as a lawn fertilizer,0
Lauren Bacall and Charles Boyer do not provide the right chemistry here in this 1945 filmThere is a good story here about the Axis trying to obtain coal to use for the upcoming war Unfortunately this part of the story is not emphasized Instead we deal with a supposedly bungling Boyer By the way Bacall is as British as Vladimir PutinThe real acting kudos goes to veteran Oscar winner Katina Paxinou As was the case with her memorable Pilar in the 1943 Oscar winner For Whom the Bell Tolls Paxinou again plays a Spanish revolutionary but this time she is a doublecrossing counterspy for the proFranco group She is quite a vicious character hereespecially when she throws a 14 year old child out the window She believed that Boyer had given the child important material to hide,0

how can you take her hardliving glamorously violent bounty hunter story serious with that accent Its absurd Apart from that the visual style of the directer is nauseating and gimmicky the plot is a shallow boring confused gangstermovie rehash and the acting is unconvincing The film introduces new characters all the way throughout the film and is told in fragmented flashback mostly out of sequence seemingly just to keep you nice and confused The film ever shows you THINGS THAT DONT REALLY HAPPEN and then later says that didnt really happen this happened see the apparent killing of the fake first ladies What have we seen the first wrong sequence of events for thenTerrible choice in casting a convoluted messy plot and a headacheinducing directorial style 15,0
This movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst I have seen it confuses you incredibly The fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film A truly truly bad film,0
I had no idea that Mr Izzard was so damn funny It really boggles the mind that he is not more well known His command over the crowd and his timing is perfectThe monologue about Star Wars will kill ya too If only all the stand up performers had his wit,1
Dope Sick Love is a really remarkable documentary made for HBO about two pairs of heroin addicted lovers roaming the streets of NYC I managed to catch it one night by accident and found it absolutely mesmerizing There is no narration and we never see any interviews with the subjects the camera just follows them around like a third eye completely detached The people being followed dont even seem aware that theyre being filmed or at least they dont seem to care The footage is amazingly candid Some of the most candid Ive ever seen This is as real as it gets The nuts and bolts of what its like to be on the street and addicted to heroin We watch them score dope shoot it make up hustle and even impersonate cops to rob people and about a million other tiny details that less observant documentary filmmakers would leave outSome of the footage is truly horrifying Like watching one guy frantically searching for fix he lost I found myself praying that he would find it just so that his misery would temporarily end And when he does find it the guy literally dances in the streetThe cyclical nature of drug addiction becomes very apparent while watching this EVERYTHING is about getting the next score to these folks yet the next score seems to be well worth the immense trouble they go through I would love to get a copy of this if anyone knows where it is available Highly recommended if you can catch it on HBO,1
i must say that this movie had a great cast locations music and camera work Cameron Diaz was great she had a very exciting roll very uproarish while Jordana Brewster had a serious roll yet still capturing one for me Jordanas very nostalgic she reminds of a female classmate of mine what realy got me in this movie were the very skillfully planned camera work and the choosing of the locations the story is very talently written it is a must see one the ones who are into mystery movies should watch this one i guarantee you all that itll keep you in your seats till the end,1
It was originally meant to be a film that Gene Kelly would star in but when the makers couldnt get him they got the greatest actor in the world and the result is pretty good Basically Nathan Detroit Frank Sinatra is having trouble doing what he does best setting up a high stakes crap dice game because he needs 1000 to get the place So to get the money he needs he has a 1000 bet with old friend Sky Masterson Marlon Brando that he cant get Sergeant Sarah Brown Great Expectations Golden Globe winning and BAFTA nominated Jean Simmons to go with him to Havana Meanwhile Nathan is having trouble trying to get rid of the woman who wants him to ask her hand in marriage Miss Adelaide Vivian Blaine Also starring Robert Keith as Lieutenant Brannigan Stubby Kaye as Nicely Nicely Johnson and BS Pulley as Big Jule An interesting romantic comedy musical with Brando singing all his own songs and Sinatra being smooth and cool It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art DirectionSet Decoration Best Cinematography Best Costume Design and Best Music for Jay Blackton and Cyril J Mockridge it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture MusicalComedy Frank Sinatra was number 43 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons Marlon Brando was number 30 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars he was number 11 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols he was number 4 on 100 Years 100 Stars Men Sinatra was number 35 and Brando was number 1 on The Worlds Greatest Actor Luck Be a Lady was number 42 on 100 Years 100 Songs for the film was number 23 on 100 Years of Musicals and it was number 36 on The 100 Greatest Musicals Very good,1
Ive seen a lot of crap in my day but goodness Hot Rod takes the cake I saw a free screening in NY the other night I can only hope they show the funny version to the paying customers The big laughs were sparse the plot was uninteresting and the characters were one dimensional at best One highlight is a hilarious dancing scene with Adam Samberg It was priceless and was the only scene I truly had a hearty laugh at Other than that I can only recollect randomness and dead air SNL Samberg fans may be disappointed I know I was expecting more from it But it short I definitely would not recommend attending a free screening or paying to watch this film,0
Wow Jeez I dont even know where to begin commenting on this thing they called a movie I seriously dont know what the hell David Bradley began smoking after making Hard Justice which in my opinion was quite a good movie after the American Ninja features I hadnt seen any of this guys latter movies after Cyborg Cop Lucky I saw them on Amazon for like 5 pounds each and I can safely say the following if I had thrown down the drain the 5 pounds I spent on Total Reality Crisis and Expect to Die I would have ended up happier than having to sit through the 90 minutes that each of them lasted My God how the HECK can anybody label these as movies And why do actionmartial arts actors fall kneedeep into the smelliest horsedung when theyve like reached their peak I mean David Bradleys no Oscar deserver but his first movies were pretty entertaining Tough cool guy with pretty good martial expertise who delivered corny lines but at least entertained action and martial arts fans to a certain extent But I seriously would love to know what went through this guys head after making Hard Justice His final 3 movies have to frankly be the WORST I have ever had to sit through As I mentioned before Id love to get my money back on the 3 DVDs I bought Crisis was the epitome of sleepiness Total Reality was harsh but this Expect to Die is just utter nonsense I bet the director was either megastoned when he made this or he was just taking the pee out of every David Bradley fan who would sit through this heap of crap The plot circles around a doctor Bradley who develops some type of Virtual Reality game in which hes just killing different people off one by one Sorry but I just couldnt take this guy seriously playing a baddie with that posh hairdo glasses and gray slacks and doing absolutely NO physical fighting whatsoever frankly his best asset The film is even worse than any of those Saturday afternoon Bmovies because the acting is laughable the directing is horrendous and the few fights in the movie well what can I say The actors look like theyre training with their gym buddy We get a dumb muscular cop who starts to show off his fighting stuff like one hour into the movie and fails heavily a french hairy version of Van Damme who just cant fight act or speak to save his freaking life and Bradley the supposed protagonist playing the evil doctor who I was really happy for when he stopped making this type of expendable rubbish I even reckon he didnt throw a kick in this movie probably due to his heart condition already playing up on him For a Bactor I must admit I really liked this guy his style physique fighting skills But Im really really glad he stopped acting after this monstrosity because I honestly wouldnt have been able to sit through another ninety minutes of peetaking material like this one Avoid at all costs even if youre family of David Bradley youll be glad you did word,0
I was wondering what possessed the organizers of the Victoria Film Festival to include this film in their program I guess they must have agreed with the others who have reviewed this film I on the other hand consider it the worst film I have ever seen It starts with a bad script full of holes and dialog so unlikely its embarrassing Ideas are introduced then dropped with no development The acting left me totally cold and uninvolved The set decoration was appropriate for the time but a decorators nightmare The only way the characters could love this house is if their previous homes had been ghastly The attic looked as if the items had been thrown in for the scene with no attempt to create the look of a real attic that has been filling with junk over the years The photography was leaden and lacking in variety Save your money for something worthwhile,0
Sometimes laughter in the middle of a horror film is a signal of its greatness I remember the nervous laughter from the audience in the rerelease of The Excorcist really nervous laughter It punctuated just how freaked out we all were watching the voice of Satan coming out of a 12 year old girl In the case of the 2006 remake of the 1972 cult classic The Wicker Man however it made me think that this new Wickerman is about as scary as the South Park character Scuzzlebut the friendly forest monster with TVs Patrick Duffy for a leg and a celery stalk for an arm whos favorite hobby is weaving wicker baskets3 years ago a friend of mine in Hollywood told me that he heard that Nicolas Cage was going to do a remake of the film I started laughing and my friend Keith got mad at me touting Nicolas Cage as a great actor I just didnt think that he could pull it off and unfortunately for moviegoers I was right Gone is the realness the outstanding original music the originality the creepiness and the wonderfully powerful dialogue Instead we have horror movie clichs affected acting and changes to the storyline that make any believability fall apart Like many of the countless Hollywood remakes we have been inundated with lately this feels like we are watching 4th graders on a playground playing WickermanThe original film takes place on a remote Scottish Isle where a Scottish police officer is lured there to find a missing young girl named Rowan Morrison In the new spin a California cop Cage is lured to an island of the coast of Washington state by his exgirlfriend to find her missing daughter She sends a photo and the missing daughter looks exactly like a young girl he tried to save in a fiery crash not long ago The crash still haunts him in part because the girls body was never found Yet even after he gets a letter with her picture in it that connection is completely cast aside as he heads north alone to help his exgirlfriend find her daughter He arrives to find an island full of actors pretending to be the descendants of Wiccans many of whom seem like they didnt get call backs for roles in The Village And like The Village it isnt long before you realize there is nothing to be afraid of here Not even the cloudy eyed blind sisters who speak in unisonI think that the opportunity in Hollywood to make great amounts of money on a film often comes at great expense to the artistry I think someone like Nicolas Cage who is in so many films these days loses touch with the magic that film can be when it gets to the point where he has a personal chef on the set preparing his snacks We needed a bad remake of the Wickerman like we needed yet another 911 movie Im starting to wonder if Nicolas changed his surname from Coppola because he wanted to or because he was pleaded with to do so,0
Previous comments encouraged me to check this out when it showed up on TCM but it was a severe disappointment Lupe Valdez is great but doesnt get enough screen time Frank Morgan and Eugene Palette play familiar but promising characters but the script leaves them strandedThe movie revolves around the ego of Lee Tracys character who is at best a selfcentered physically and verbally abusive jerk The reactions of the public are poorly thoughtout and unbelievable making the shenanigans seem like contrivances of a bad writer And it strains credulity that the Lupe Velez character could fall for himThe stinging oneliners mentioned in another review must be dependent on the observer since I didnt even notice that an attempt was being made,0
There wasnt a 0 in the voting option so i was compelled to use the next available figureIt is a sad day for bollywood when such type of movies which have starcast actors is nothing more are than a bunch of juvenile acting and an awful scriptThis movie is nowhere near to be called a clone of Hitch Salman khan with his usual takeoffyoushirt theme and Govinda with his inhumorous laughs If somebody had told 2 decades ago that I would be writing a comment on Salman after his success with Maine Pyar Kiya I would have written himher off,0
This movie is poorly conceived poorly acted and poorly writtenJon Heder is terribly annoying and cannot escape the same Napolean Dynamite routine Selfobsessed and ignorantFurthermore Diane Keaton plays the same manish overly obsessed mother who cares too much and yet not nearly enough about the lives of her children see Because I Said So Anna Faris though i generally like her plays a vapid idiot in this film as wellJeff Daniels is passable but nothing special Please skip this film if you want to keep your soul,0
Yeah I remember this one Many years since I actually watched it The story was entirely surreal but nonetheless great What anyone who rates and reviews movies ought to bear in mind is what the respective movie aims at Its the same with First Kid which follows a similar pattern Certain movies like this one here just aim at plain and comical nonsense Such movies cant be rated from the point of view of a hypercritical reviewer Of course these movies lack quality lack a sophisticated storyline very often lack firstclass acting but if they do fulfil their primary premise thats okay I dont have this movie here on my list of alltime favorites but I still thought it was funny had some very enjoyable sequences and made a good story Brian Bonsall is a smart actor anyway,1
The Biggest one that bugs the hell out of me is that they say Zues takes DUTCH commands But she is speaking German to him The 2 languishes are completely different its like saying well he takes French commands and start talking SpanishJames Belushi gives more the feeling of being a comedy actor not a detective in the slightest The role just doesnt fit him even if its mend to be a comedyTo many stereotypepredicable stuff Typical comment or comebacksIf you dont look at those things i think it could be a nice movie to watch if its ever on TV But i wouldnt suggesting renting it,0
Well this movie was probobly one of the funniest scary movie i have ever seen The effects are so bad you just have to laugh and the acting well lets say its no mel gibson But Gary Browning who plays an police officer is so damn bad he becomes good I dont know how but he him self makes this movie a 10 You must see it if your in to horrorslash movies cause its bloody and funny at the same time Killer movie,1
I was deeply moved by this movie in many respects First of all I just want to say that Clara Lago was the most precious little thing Such a pretty little girl Her acting was superb as well True to life and very human Though I dont like the part where she had to smoke I hope it was only a fake prop Either way she was absolutely wonderful and the story was so moving I found myself immersed in the story and her characterIts quite interesting how I came to discover this movie actually I was walking in blockbuster and I just happened to notice her pretty smile on the cover as I was walking by Luckily I glanced in the downward direction that this movie was in I thought to myself Awe look at her So I picked it up and saw that this movie was described as such wonderful things as A Little Gem I read the plot on the back and then thought that well maybe Id look it up on IMDb first and then come back and rent it at a later time Im glad I didnt because I certainly would have been missing out After searching for a movie with my friend I knew that I would end up regretting not renting this film so I went back to the spot in which I originally found it and snapped it upIt had been on my dresser for a week since school started for me this week and I really hadnt any time to watch it but tonight was the perfect opportunity I popped it in and was glued to the beautiful cinematography delightful score and moving plot from beginning to end I was so captivated and must say some parts nearly moved me to tearsI would also like to make a special mention for the young boy in this film Juan Jose Ballesta He was remarkable Also the actor who played Carols father whos name is unfortunately not listed on the site His voice was just so loving and gentle that I could really sense his love for Carol Even though his appearance is not prominent I really felt his characters presenceThis is truly a wonderful movie If you are a person who is moved by light but emotional films then this is definitely one for you,1
John Ford paid the wagons his tribute of a special picture Wagon Master made after two big Indiancavalry epics It is a lovely poetic movie full of romanticized reincarnation of the pioneer spirit It didnt have to top the big ones that had preceded itPhotographically it is extremely simple The camera moves only once or twice in the entire film and never when a director would have made it move to underline a shot Ford even resists the temptation to track his camera in the breathtaking twilight shots of the women wearily marching along in the dust behind their wagons They comeand gowhile the camera remains immobile and the audience stays a spectator to the march of history not a participant in it Of course when Ford wants to involve his audience emotionally or dramatically as in Stagecoach he knows just how to do it But Wagon Master is a tender nostalgic look backwardFilled with traditional Western songs rendered by The Sons of the Pioneers it tells of the trek West to Utah in 1879 of a Mormon wagon train led by Ward Bond in the role of Elder Wiggs and two young horse traders Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr And in a series of beautiful images as the wagon train fights outlaws Indians and nature in its struggle to reach the promised land the modest Wagon Master manages to capture the history and legend of the West Ford himself has said that Wagon Master of which he wrote the original story was among the three films of his which came closest to being what I had wanted to achieveFords career as a Western director was astonishing More than anyone else he was able to use the genre to protect his feelings about the family society and the American way of life Ford saw the frontier as a land to be subdued by a special class of settlers and lawmen whose great sacrifices make the land safe from those who come after These early westerners were giants who deserved the legendary status they earned and the civilized townsfolk who followed must always hold them in fear and respect Fords Westerns often employ flashbacks that emphasize the historical authenticity of his approachIn Wagon Master for example folk songs on the sound track tell us of the hardships of the pioneers of a century ago and Ford shows them to us in almost documentary fashion In one sequence the train is camped in a circle and the settlers decide to hold a square dance To fashion a dance floor they have to lay boards over the desert sand and with this ritual celebration Ford shows the defeat of the wilderness through the metaphor of boarding over the landIts a lovelytolookat film full of a marvelous lighthearted optimism and it is easy to understand why Ford found it so satisfying It never breaks faith with the mood and style set in the first few sequences But one is left wondering whether the ultraromantic best suits the chosen theme The wagontrain experience must have been one of the most physically demanding and nervewracking ordeals that man with his womankind ever set himself It must have been riddled with doubtswas I wrong to sell up everything and come How can we hope to survive How will we contend the other endalmost every other aching step of the way Yet none of this feeling really comes through in Wagon Master The journeysuch is the general ebulliencedoes not strike one as particularly hazardous It could be of course that the Mormons were so high on religious spirit that this tended to act as an anesthetic In other words their reactions werent those of normal human weakness If so Ford was right and the doubters were wrong What is beyond doubt is the right and proper ebullience especially at first meeting of Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr This is the essence of lighthearted adventurous youth particularly one feels of Western youth of those extraordinary times Its a remarkable relationship and it remains lodged in the mind,1
This is truly a funny movie His dance scene done with the tape is one of the funniest scenes I can recall I thought the I am gay scene at the high school graduation ceremony a bit surrealistic though it was funny While watching it for the third time I started to pick up on a little small segments that I had missed One was when Matt Dillons girl friend a classic ditz tried to use a dial phone which she had never used before Kevin Klein made this film successful along Tom Selleck This was also the first time I could appreciate Debbie Reynolds she proved that she can be funny She confirmed this in the TV series Will and Grace One discovery that I found after the third viewing is Lauren Ambrose of 6 Feet Under fame She sticks out with her red bangs but it is obvious that this is one of her first films Bob Newhart is also very funny at the high school principle,1
Andrewjlau I could not agree more My girlfriend is watching this at this very moment and I find this movie appalling Quote from my Chinese girlfriend laughing They are doing all this for a man I find these women have no intensity no sense of the a fight between tragedy and identity and that these men are hardly worth fighting for During the dance scene where Zhang Zi Yi wins them over the men look stupid more than admiringJapanese people have much more intensity than Chinese people and being geisha is Japanese culture I am sure the Chinese had something similar but the faces do not match the mainAnyway the dialogue is so unmysterious so American Had a European done it with European orientals they would have done a far better jobI have to add it seems most of the people who liked the film are American Sorry to say but no wonder All spelt out for you not instinctive not passionate I think the Chinese actresses are lovely but I could not say they were good actors in this film Yes the cinematography is great but really I cannot see how it can be seen that these characters are complex deep individualsIm going to Japan to see the real thing I am sure that would be amazing to see,0
Nowhere near the original Its quite accurate copy bringing nothing new to the story But the directing is very poor Basinger is weak without good directing Baldwin is simply just a second league compared to McQueen I watched it just out of curiosity being a huge fan of Peckinpahs masterpiece and I got what I thought Almost a B movie with second rate acting and directing I wasnt even disappointed I just dont know what they were trying to do This remake doesnt try to play with the original material its not a tribute and indeed it lacks some really good actor of its eraIt reminds me of a bad xerox copy of wonderful photographThis is a complete waste of your time Save yourself 2 hours or watch the original again,0
Hey you are not alone I remember Nichols I was just 17 when it was on I remember James Garner was one of the coolest actors and Nichols was such a great show I couldnt believe it was on such a short time wish I could remember the last episode I probably didnt see itthere were no vcrs back then so it when it was on you saw it and if you missed an episode it was gone forever unless it came back on summer reruns Anyway sure would be great if it came out on DVD but I dont think that many people even knew about it What a shameGarner would hit it big a few years later with Rockford Files and he brought along his buddy Stuart Margolin from Nichols to play his sidekick Angel,1
I watch a TON of movies and enjoy the occasional B movie but this movie was awful Aside from the homemade quality of the film it was very slow and seemed to make no point Im only commenting bc of another comment I saw here that said it was great WOW Maybe OK to watch on a rainy day when nothing else is availableThe characters were disjointed and didnt fit any discernible pattern of reality The dialog between characters was forced and at times very confusingI guess if you were very into the whole area 51 and understood some of the nuances other comments reference it may be good but for me the Average Joe I dont get it,0
The only reason I watched this movie a second time was to learn the name of the second banana girl playing opposite Katie Holms Her name is Marisa Coughlan Never heard of her before She is lovely Captivating With an animated face and cute bod she is highly watchable Shes got real Poisenality More than a passing vibe of Grace Kelly with youthful exuberance I think she is Irish in gene pool my favorite female DNA so it makes some sense that she would resemble the most beautiful Irish American The movie is unremarkable Katie Holms is classic beauty in the flesh But Marisa Coughlan is the one you follow with your eyes In 1999 when this movie was made she was around 25 years old in her prime This reminds me of another silly worthless movie with the only redemption being the Pretty Girl in it It was Career Opportunites with the first time I saw Jennifer Conoly Or Grease II the first time I saw Michelle Pfeiffer,0
Robert Mitchum stars as Clint Tollinger in this short but tough western Man With The Gun Tollinger is a professional town tamer as in when a town needs someone to save itself he is the one who is brought in to do it Tollingers latest gig comes by as an accident strolling into town looking for his former fling he stumbles into a town being played like a puppet by a local western gangster But many townspeople begin to rue the day they hired Tollinger as his way of cleaning up the town becomes very taxing suddenly High Plains Drifter seems less original Man With The Gun starts off as an average western toughguy film but begins to surprise you more and more as the film progresses What starts off as forgettable and runofthemill ends up dark and charactercentered The entire film is very well shot and the cast is very enjoyable Mitchum is his usual excellent self here in Man With The Gun not one of his very best performances Mitchum still has his classic and effective toughguy screen presence in high gear and he knocks the actionpacked meaningful and shocking scenes of the film right out of the park Man With The Gun is a nice Mitchum western and is easily worth ones time,1
Tony Scott destroys anything that may have been interesting in Richard Kellys clichd patchy overwrought screenplay Domino Harvey Kiera Knightley was a model who dropped out and became a bounty hunter This is her story sort ofThe problem with this rubbish is that there isnt much of a story at all and Scotts extreme graphic stylization of every shot acts as a distancing mechanism that makes us indifferent to everything in Harveys chaotic lifeYou just dont care about Harvey Knightley plays her as an obnoxious cynical brat who has done nothing to warrant our respect She punches people she doesnt like and sheds her clothes and inhibitions when the situation calls for it but she isnt the least bit real and Knightly isnt the least bit convincing eitherThe film is boring Its loud too and shackled with one of the most annoying source music scores Ive heard in a long time The final twenty minutes are a poor rerun of Scotts True Romance climax with Dominos gang going to meet two sets of feuding bad guys who are surprise surprise destined to shoot it out with each other at the top of a Las Vegas casinoUnfortunately this potentially exciting conflagration is totally botched by Scott and becomes a confusing pretentious pointless exercise in celluloid masturbation This is not an artistically brave or experimental piece it is a failure on every level because it gives us no entry point to the lives and dilemmas of its charactersMickey Roarke looks good as a grizzled bounty hunter but he disappears into the background as the narrative progresses Chris Walken turns in another embarrassing cameo and Dabney Coleman always solid is underutilizedDont be fooled by this films multilayered gimmickridden surface It is still a turd no matter how hard you polish it,0
Like a twisty country road Tough Luck takes the viewer for a ride There is nothing wrong with plot curves as long as believability doesnt fly out the window Unfortunately in the end the film does challenge an audiences belief tolerance Nevertheless it is easy to forgive this fault due to the superior acting character development and wonderful carnival atmosphere Do not expect to like any of the characters Armand Asante Norman Redus and Dagmara Dominczyk play shady conartists not exactly the type of person easily admired The double crosses come fast and furious and the final cross is a bit of a stretch Recommended MERK,1
Felix is watching an actor rehearse his lines A ham A ham My kingdom for a ham sandwich The dramatic guy that tells Felix hell have to sacrifice my art and go into the movies Hes in tears Felix just looks at him like hes nuts and shrugs his shoulders The old guy tells Felix to go ye forth and find money to finance a trip to Hollywood Felix thinks How does he expect me to get the moneyIn minutes of course this is a cartoon he spots a shoe business owner putting up a bankrupt sale on his store Felix comes up with a plan to bail him out and the man promises the cat 500 if it worksWell it does but the man wants to go alone and leave Felix at home In an outrageous scene Felix transforms himself into a briefcase and thats how he gets to Hollywood transforming himself back to cat when they get thereWe then witness Felixs attempts at getting into show business His audition scenes are very funny especially with his imitation of Charlie Chaplin In addition there are caricatures of some famous silent film stars and executives In all quite a bit of material is in this 95 minute cartoon Its amazing how much more you can get in an extra 25 minutes assuming most animated shorts are seven minutes in lengthAt any rate there were a number of laughs in here and more zany things you could only see in a cartoon like Felix have a sword duel with giant mosquitoes Crazy stuff,1
Having ran across this film on the Fox movie channel on a lazy Friday afternoon I can think of no better way to spend a lazy Friday evening then putting in my two cents worth Especially when you consider the lack of user comments on it Doesnt every movie good or bad deserve more than four comments And this movie isnt bad at allThe first thing to keep in mind when watching a film like April Love is to remember the era from which it came in this case the late fifties Films were pretty much a happy medium back then The cinemas were devoid of tragedy while the screens were filled with wide screen Technicolor films in order to pry people away from the gray glare of the evil medium in a box called television I dont know how many people were pried away from the boob tube to see this one but it managed to capture my attention for 97 minutesTeen Idol Pat Boone plays Nick Conover a young teen sent to live with his Aunt Henrietta Jeanette Nolan and Uncle Jed Arthur OConnell out in the country after being put on probation for stealing a car It seems that his Aunt and Uncle have lost their own son Jed Jrso Uncle Jed seems has lost his zest for living Aunt Henrietta is hoping that Nick being on the farm will somehow bring Jed out of his doldrums Story lines like this being what they are Jed and Nick dont really care for each other too much of course Jed then proceeds to meet up with the neighbors Fran Dolores Michaelsand Liz Shirley JonesTempleton Immediately Jed develops a crush on Fran and of course I dont have to tell you that Liz develops a crush on Jed Then theres the matter of Uncle Jeds horse a trotter who has turned wild and wont let anyone handle him since the death of Jed Jr You could probably fill in everything that happens from that point on your own seeing as how there are no real surprises Doesnt matter though youll enjoy yourself anywayOnce you get over the image of squeaky clean Pat Boone as a supposedly bad boy youll have no trouble with the rest of the film Considering that Boone does turn in a surprisingly good performance as Nick Certainly the role doesnt require much depth but still its a nicely done job when you would least expect it As Jed Arthur OConnell is the perfect choice for the role In the early going he is unreachable and cold but as he slowly warms up to Nick we see that hes really a pretty good guy Jeannette Nolan is a lot of fun as Henrietta who is constantly playing the part of mediator between Jed and Nick Shirley Jones takes a break from Rodgers And Hammerstein and gets a few opportunities to grace us with her singing talents As Liz shes gorgeous to look at great to listen to and quite funny at times Dolores Michaels as Fran who is a bit more on the wild side is equally entertainingThe best thing about April Love is that there is not a true mean conniving character of any sort on the screen Not one true villain in the whole thing Everybody is so darn likable you cant help but enjoy the film I truthfully find it quite refreshing sort of like putting your troubles behind you and enjoying a summer picnic with friends Think of it as the old Andy Griffith show with musical numbers a little more plot and wide screen Technicolor The songs are a mixed bag with the title song April Love being the best of them Another thing I really liked is that they didnt fall back on using blue screen backdrops during the horse racing sequences and they quite a bit more entertaining and exciting because of it As a matter of fact youll find the whole film beautifully photographed and it was nice to see they didnt skimp in that department The chemistry between Jones and Boone is good Best of all is how the dislike between Nick and Jed is portrayed as each try in some way to gain the others respectThis movie will never be confused with great cinema Yet sometimes instead of going to Disneyland one just needs a nice outing in the park and thats what April Love isMy Grade B,1
The previous poster obviously worked on the movie Its a joke how bad it is and no one would review this kind of movie the way he didMentioning all of the actors names and what they were in previously is a sure sign that hes involved with it in some wayIts on Cinemax right now and I was sure this was some movie where porn stars the one called Ava is gorgeous and wellendowed were forced to make something else for some crazy tax reasonAlso when I first saw it I was sure it was made in about 1986 and I was born in 73 so I thought I knew what i was talking aboutbut noit was made in 1993 UnbelievableThough I would call it one of those so bad its good movies Like watching a train wreck,0
Although there were a few rough spots and some plot lines that werent exactly true to character this was Classic HLOTS The characters outside of Mike Giardello Giancarlo Esposito were true to form and the reunion scenes of Pembleton Andre Braugher and Bayliss Kyle Secor were as deep and well acted as anything ever to grace the small screenHomicide The Movie aka Life Everlasting is a fan flick but stands on its own as well as any 2hour episode of the series Fontana Overmeyer and Yoshimura did a wonderful job in pulling loose ends from 7 seasons and every major cast member of the best damn show on television together for the series finale that NBC never bothered to give it True to Homicide form there were no happy endings such is life Thats what has always set this show apart from the mindless cookiecutter cop shows left on television Kudos to the writers and the cast for creating something over the span of the series and in the movie that challenged television viewers and producers alike I call myself a Homicidal Maniac if for no other reason than to keep my coworkers in a cooperative mood,1
When you look at the cover and read stuff about it an entirely different type of movie comes to mind than what you get here Then again maybe I read the summary for the other movie called Mausolem instead as there were two movies of this title released about the same time with both featuring plots that had key elements in common However reading stuff about that movie here I know I saw this one and not that one and that movie is even less what one would imagine a movie with that title would be about I will be honest I expect more of a zombie type picture and you get that in this movie to some degree However there is more stuff involving the occult and strange powers as the opening scene of the people being taken away by the coroner at the beginning of the film will attest to The movie also has the old theme of kids going somewhere they do not belong to have some crazy party in this case it is in fact a mausoleum The other movie I do not think really has that key feature playing that prominent role in the movie and I see the score for this one is higher too still it was just not the movie I was expecting,0
Cooley High is considered one of my best all time movies It certainly reminds me of days of my youth growing up in the cities of Cleveland and Chicago during the early mid and late 1960s What ever happened to Brenda and Pooter Some one needs to track those two down Brenda for her beauty and Pooter for his innocent wit They both deserve to be recognized even 31 years after this film was debuted I think a lot of the fans of this movie would like to find out what happened to them as well as others who acted in this fun filled movie I certainly think this movie should be entered into some type of MOVIE HALL OF FAME All of the cast of this movie was great My opinion is of Cooley High is turn back the hands of time those were the fun years,1
When I first got wind of this picture it was just called Shepherd and was supposed to be the film that would put JCVD back into chances of doing theatrical shtuff I was very well excited about the whole pieceBy the time it was titled The Shepherd Border Patrol I was tapdancing in excitement for this flick With Isaac Fluorentine at the helm of directing and JJ Perry pulling stunt coordination I almost peed me pants in anticipation Pics were released of JCVD kicking 8 different kinds of arse as well as Scott Adkins playing what I thought was the villain and I was mindblown in excitement I thought it was going to be another epic martial arts situation like Lone Wolf McQuadeThen it came out I ordered it off Blockbuster online for 20 and was ready for anything The reviews from vandammefannet kinda had my ideas alittle altered but I braced myself The mail came on day 4 and I ripped open the package My initial plan was to rush upstairs rip the face off the cardboard packaging then smash the case in the proper dynamics so the disc would land in my DVD player However I stared at the case for 10 minutes then placed the disc in my player and watched the filmBy the time it was over I was cool as a fool in the pool The Shepherd is certainly one of my alltime favorite directtovideo films ever and makes Derailed look like even more of the toilet mess that it is Sure some of the fights ran a twee bit short but they were still VERY awesome The shootouts were superb as was Scott Adkins who SHOULD have been the villain unlike the forgettable Steven LordI highly recommend this flick Seriously,1
First of all this is one of the worst softcore straight to cable erotic thriller Ive ever seen in my life Of course like all erotic thrillers are want to do its about a brothel madam and is set in a brothel This of course makes the softcore simulated sex that pops up every other 10 minutes seem in context WhateverForget for one moment that this was never meant to win any awards The actors are terrible and their line reading made me cringe The woman who plays the female cop is so bad its beyond description She must be a really REALLY good friend of the guys who put up the movie for this terrible adventure if you know what I meanThe production values are only slightly higher than porn Other than that I suppose if youre really drunk and you need something to laugh at this would be a perfect film And if thats the case I recommend fast forwarding to all the scenes with the female cop Whats that accent Brooklyn Hilarious,0
Hey Arnold is a slowpaced and slightly boring movie The plot is not very creative The Paul Sorvino character Shenk is buying all of the decrepit lowpriced buildings in order to build a gigantic mall shopping complex and office buildings This plot goes back to many 1960s kids movies It is boring Paul Sorvino is not very exciting either so the idea of him as the bad guy is not very scary Gramps remembers something about a historical document and the rest of the movie is about the last 36 hours when Arnold and Jamal must find the document with the undercover aid of Helga whose father is hoping to become rich thanks to Shenks Mall The kids must move around town on buses and so the exciting chase scene involving a bus is not only silly but underscores how this movie is written for very young kids Hey Arnold the TV cartoon is usually very entertaining and it has enough humor to appeal to adults The TV cartoon is usually faster paced and more imaginative than this movie Hey Arnold the movie is about five times more sedated and a good way to put anyone including kiddies to sleep Hey Arnold was a tough one to stay awake all the way until the predictable and totally boring ending If you want to send your kids to a totally nonoffensive movie this is it I get the feeling that instead of trying to make a 90 minute movie the producers started out with a 30 minute TV cartoon script and tried to expand it into 90 minutes This Mall Story definitely could have been covered in the TV cartoon Hopefully Arnold will bet a better writer if there is ever a sequel,0
FORBIDDEN PLANET is the best SF film from the golden age of SF cinema and what makes it a great film is its sense of wonder As soon as the spaceship lands the audience via the ships human crew travels through an intelligent and sometimes terrifying adventure We meet the unforgetable Robbie the mysterious Dr Morbuis his beautiful and innocent daughter Altair and we learn about the former inhabitants of the planet The Krell who died out overnight Or did they You can nitpick and say the planet is obviously filmed in a movie studio with painted backdrops but that adds to a sense of menace of claustraphobia I feel and Bebe and Louis Barrons electronic music adds even more atmosphere Im shocked this film isnt in the top 250 IMDB films,1
A Wes Craven presents movie from 1995 directed by Joe Clayton and starring Lance Henriksen A group of scientists save a dying man they find by their desert stranded government outpost by injecting him with their experimental virus of course one of their colleagues goes overboard and the virus transforms the man into a near unstoppable monster with them trapped inside Lance Henriksen plays the morally offended researcher who leaves the project before all this but returns after receiving a call for help to save the man preunstoppable death machine mutationDeciding to combine two trips in one he brings his family along with him theyre going on vacation afterwards and proceeds to give them entry to the top secret government facility thus putting them right in the middle of the chaos within In case you cant tell this one relies on the viewer to work with it a little and put aside some petty see major and blatant detailsOverall though Watchable with mild bits of enjoyment Note The Outpost is commonly known under the title Mind Ripper,0
This is the result of the town of Milpitas California making a home movie and subjecting the rest of the world to it Legendary in some circles as the biggest cinematic turkey this movie is rightly thought of as a bad movie Part comedy part giant monster horror movie this movie is full of non actors not acting the plot has something to do with a giant monster being created from the garbage and pollution in the area and going on a rampage The monster which we dont see until the final 20 minutes is rather cool looking but isnt cool enough to warrant watching the preceding hour of boredom Frankly even hardened bad movie lovers are going to have a tough time getting through to the end This is a stinker,0
This is part one of a short animation clip showing the history of the Matrix the war between man and machine that resulted in the eventual creation of the Matrix The animation is part Japanese anime part contemporary american animation and is very well made considering the excellent directors behind the movie It shows the initial development of AI and the exploitation of the machines by Man until the day they rebelled,1
I absolutely adore the book written by Robin Klein so I was very excited when I heard that a movie based on the book was in the makingBut I was severely disappointed with the movie when I did see it because it didnt capture what I loved about the book the absolutely ridiculously funny Erica and the interesting way in which she views the worldFrom the start of the movie I realised that things werent the same as I had imagined in the book So I just went along for the ride It wasnt all that bad I guess Miss Belmont was totally different to what I had imagined her to be I didnt think she would be one to smoke and drink Jean Kittson who plays her is hilariousOn its own I thought the movie and its actorsactresses in it did a good job but alas Im such a fan of the book one of my all time favourite books that I couldnt help but feel disappointed P,0
Ive been trying to write a plot summary for several minutes now and cant seem to do it But with a movie as bad as Night of the Blood Beast the plot hardly matters An astronaut crash lands and is believed dead His body later reanimates but is found to be carrying the embryos of some strange alien lifeform But how did they get there And wheres the alien that implanted the strange creatures in Maj John Corcorans body IMDb lists the runtime for Night of the Blood Beast at 62 minutes Is that right 62 minutes It had to be longer than that It felt interminable to me Even with the MST3K commentary which was very funny by the way the actual movie felt much much longer And its pretty much a snoozer from beginning to end I like a lot of these alien invasion type movies of the 50s but not this one It failed to grab my interest on any level The baby aliens were too silly looking to be taken seriously the titular blood beast was pathetic and none of the characters did anything for me Add to that the usual lowbudget Roger Corman trappings and youve got a real loser of a movie,0
I saw this on Sci Fi and in retrospect Im not sure how I actually managed to watch it all the way through This is utter trash Its not a B movie its a D movie at bestBasically this grim reaper looking thing on a horse and sometimes not on one goes killing everything in its path somewhere in the mid west of America A load of people are missing infact murdered and a bunch of mismatched spec op soldier types go looking for them The best part of this movie Ill tell it now is theres some really cute girls Let me now spoil this by telling you that all but the least cute one get their heads either chopped off slashed apart or hit so hard with a mle weapon that the head explodes off Thats no spoiler The gore in this movie is over the top and really grotesque It serves no real purpose eitherHeres whats good The sets look OK the actors sometimes act OK The outfits and props some of them are decentEverything else that you can think of sucks A lot of the badness is in the editing Some times it just switches over from a rapid action scene to a real quiet and dormant scene Sometimes the characters do nonunderstandable things and theyre always splitting up but not even in a way that the viewer can follow Looks like they get split up without realizing it amongst themselves but they also all seem to know that theyre splitting up all the time and are OK with it even tho theyre in a really dangerous situation and theres bodies all over the place and people are dying right and left Nothing in this movie is the least bit plausible most of it is incoherent and confusing and I dont really get how this immortal indestructible bad guy killer was able to be stopped in the end and frankly I dont care Too much stupid hilariously bad nonsense happens during this movie and I dont really care to list it all here And theyre all so serious throughout the whole ordeal when its almost laughably bad just awfulThis movie is a complete waste of time Theres no excuse for watching this unless the only channel you happen to receive is SciFi and youre bound to a chair in front of the TV But if youre not bound youre better off doing a crossword throwing a Frisbee or even just thinking Theres lots of much better B movies that you can watchMy senior year in high school my friend and I in visual communication and deign class made a long movie trailer type deal for our own movie There was no full movie just a really long trailer and we did a better job of filming and editing the piece with premiere It was better work than this movie That really says something about this and Im puzzled and troubled as to why Sci Fi would show anything like this when there are so many good low rate movies they can showThe only movie that Ive ever endured that was worse than this is Raptor Island another brilliant SciFi workthough it had smoother and more followable flow than this movie but this comes very close and is definitely 2nd on my list of worst movies Ive ever seen,0
Maybe its unfair to dislike a movie for what it isnt rather than what it is but I approached this hoping that finally a filmmaker would make a movie about smalltown rural gay men and women Instead the focus is primarily on the outrageous bigotry big news of the locals and those in outlying areas and the really gruesome torturemurder of a young gay manSo much time devoted to stupid people squawking about AIDS sin hellfire and perverts So much time devoted to the ghoulish preacher ranting about the Bible and gay people getting what they deserveI wanted to see more of the people that came to the small town gay bar not those who opposed it In addition the young man who was murdered isnt even from this townThe whole movie works as a warning rather than a celebration and its very suspect,0
Steven Seagal Mr Personality himself this time is the United States greatest Stealth pilot who is promised a pardon from the militarywho attempted to swipe his memory at the beginning of the movie for which he escaped base later caught after interrupting a gang of robbers in a shootout at a gas stationif he is able to successfully infiltrate a Northern Afghanistan terrorist base operated by a group called Black Sunday who have commandeered an Air Force stealth fighter thanks to an American traitor Along with a fellow pilot who admired the traitor JannickMark Bazeley John SandsSeagalwill fly into enemy territory receiving help from his Arab lover JessicaCiera Paytonand a freedom fighter RojarAlki David once they are on ground Jannick is kidnapped by Black Sunday leaders StoneVincenzo Nicoliand his female enforcer ElianaKatie Jones and Sands must figure out how to not only retake command of the kidnapped stealth fighter but rescue him as well And maybe Sands can get revenge on the traitor he trained RatherSteve Toussaintin the process Sands has 72 hours until a Generals Navy pilots bomb the entire area On board the stealth Black Sunday equipped a biochemical bomb hoping to detonate it on the United StatesSeagal gets a chance to shoot Afghans when he isnt slicing their throats with knives The film is mostly machine guns firing and bodies dropping dead The setting of Afghanistan doesnt hold up to scrutinynor does how easily Seagal and co are able to move about the area undetected so easily and the plot itself is nothing to write home about The movie is edited fast the camera a bit too jerky Seagal isnt as active a hero as he once was and his action scenes are tightly edited where we have a hard time seeing him taking out his foes unlike the good old days One of Seagals poorest efforts and hes as understated as evernot a compliment Even more disappointing is the fact that Seagal never fights in hand to hand combat with the films chief villains tis a shame He doesnt even snap a wrist or crack a neck in any visible waysure we see a slight resemblance of some tool getting tossed around but its not as clear a picture as I enjoy because the filmmakers have such fast edits and dizzying closeups,0
First at all If you like watching movies I recommend you NOT to watch this one Why Afterwards you wont appreciate any other movie so easily anymoreActually I dont wanna give rise to any excessive expectations but it is almost frightening how perfect intense and beautiful this work of Einar Gudmundsson is When in most movies there is at least one aspect spoiling the whole thing like good actors but horrible dialogs or a nice scenery but low budget cinematography in Angels of the Universe there is nothing of this ambivalence Really everything is just great even and not least the soundtrack with the magnificent Sigur RsIn this story about Pall a student that goes schizophrenic after being dumped by his girlfriend especially the dialogs and monologues deserve some attention together with and sometimes in sharp contrast to the plot they range from depressing and fatalistic to the whole opposite of comical and totally absurd What is more they are often with quotes from Hegel and Shakespeare of such a poetic beauty that the movie almost drifts into a surreal sphere and is only saved to the real world by its incredibly authentic actorsOne of the other comments was already referring to another point This movie is no trivial entertainment for relaxing in the evening Despite of several comical reliefs in between it is largely disturbing partly cynical and bitter and most of all sad It is a modern poetry about a life of insanity with all its emptiness rage and solitudeFinally When youve seen the movie watch it again There are some great visual metaphors and allusions in it that you realize only when you look twice and connect them with the moral of the story And of course read the book it contains a lot more of the small funny stories in between and also makes you understand some things in the movie a bit better,1
The beginning of this movie is excellent with tremendous sound and some nice humor but once the film changes into animation it quickly loses its appealOne of the reasons that was so at least for me was that the colors in much of the animation are too muted with too little contrast It doesnt look good at least on VHS Once in a while it breaks out and looks great but not often Also the characters come and go too quickly For example I would have liked to have seen more of Moby Dick When the film starts to drag however it picks up again with the entrance of the dragon and then the film finishes strong Overall just not memorable enough or able to compete with the great animated films of the last dozen years,0
Slipknot is a hardcore rock band from Des Moines Iowa Nine band members who all wear customized boilersuits and personalized homemade masks eg 6s clown mask 0s various gasmasks 8s tattered torn crashtest dummie mask with dreadlocks The music itself seems to walk the finelines between sane and otherwise yet is performed so brilliantly and psychoticWelcome To Our Neighborhood sounds rather a generic title but the footage itself is something else Interviews with the band soundbites from their latest selftitled album 2 live performances and one bannedbyMTV music video a brilliant homage to the classic Kubrick film The Shining the movie clocks in at not even halfanhour but is certainly worth it It is perfect for introducing any metalhardcore fan to Slipknot,1
This moody creepy horror flick begins on a castle atop a cliff overlooking the sea a great setting as a vampire bat flies in and creeps toward a sleeping doctor Onslow Stevens The bat changes into a man known as Baron Latos in reality Count Dracula John Carradine He seeks Dr Edelmanns help to cure him of his vampirism Eventually the good doctor also wants to help his hunchbacked nurseassistant Jane Adams the Wolf Man Lon Chaney and Frankensteins monster Glenn Strange But Draculas trickery contaminates the doctors blood and he becomes a JekyllHyde vampire himself This is somewhat better than the prior years House of Frankenstein being less episodic and more exciting visually Theres a haunting scene where Dracula tries to lure the second nurse Martha ODriscoll into his world where she is initially playing Moonlight Sonata on the piano which soon gives way to terrifying music Director Erle Kenton uses expressionistic shadows and eerie music to frame many sequences including a wonderful montage sequence that the studio frequently used in their horror features Two performers are of note Stevens with his wonderful voice is at first sympathetic then convincingly menacing Adams her beautiful face in alarming contrast to her twisted body exhibits great pathos and sympathy It all ends in a slambang climax typical of 1940s Universal horror a little abrupt with footage borrowed from The Ghost of Frankenstein 1942 I hope Universal releases it soon on DVD it was left out of their DoubleFeature releases,1
Well this latest version of Mansfield Park seemed to try and take the edginess of the 1999 theatrical version outright copied some of the ideas from it in fact but tone things down a bit to bring it more in line with the original story Unfortunately the result is a rather lackluster and schizophrenic production And as with all the other versions of Mansfield Park out there the character of Fanny Price is no where to be found Instead there is a strangely childlike bleachedblond woman running around who never really fully develops as a character At least in the 1999 movie the character they call Fanny Price is firmly established as rebellious tomboy who is too clever for her own good This Fanny Price is a complete enigma Someday I would really like to see a dramatization of Mansfield Park that actually includes a depiction of the character of Fanny as she was written by Jane Austen A sweet kind compassionate girl with a timid personality and frail constitution She is reserved in manner and painfully honest but also strong in her convictions unfailingly loyal extremely intelligent and remarkably astute A bit of a late bloomer it is not until her eighteenth year that she finally begins to make the transition from awkward adolescent to selfpossessed young woman And she wants nothing more in life than to be of some real use to those she loves most Its a wonderfully complex character that I look forward to one day seeing faithfully portrayed,0
The story of Macbeth was one of the most successful Shakespeare ever wrote This may be due to some features that place it close to the slasher genre murder murder kill kill gallons of blood a tense sexual relation between the main characters etc More than this the original play is very appealing taking into consideration the length its only half the size of Hamlet and the focus on Macbeth for whom we are constrained to care in spite of his bloody nature The play would seem ideal to base a movie on Not so lengthy it gives the directors the possibility to explore its many levels a good actor can play the role of his lifetime the film has deep meaning in any historical period Unfortunately this has not been the case with Macbeth Polanskis version comes quite close but it insists too much on the medieval period Welles film is too personal with an interesting twist towards totalitarianism the 1990 or so TV version is too shallow This 2006 movie is no exception It is very far from a Shakespeare film but it is interesting to see how the director understood the story and where he places it in contemporary life No knights in shiny armor but gangsters in shiny cars A lot of drugs and trippy music replace the dread of night in the original play The idea of Macbeth is so simple that to take and implant it in modern day life doesnt need Shakespeare at all The worst part in the film are the lines Most of the poignant scenes of the play such as the dagger scene are trimmed so much they seem pointless Replacing the knocks in the door with doorbells and horses with cars seems funny If they wanted to make a movie about power and its temptation they could have done it easily without Shakespeare This Macbeth seems to be a looser with a brain injury not a valiant warrior brave and ambitious that wants power so much he is prepared to to kill and who gets caught up in a net of fears and despair The movie doesnt make clear what drives Lady Macbeth to madness it doesnt give a reason why some of the characters should fear Macbeth and his terror since there is no hereditary ascension to the throne what with no throne and all and it places Macbeth in an awkward position since the leadership of a gang is as far from kingship as this whole movie is far from any Shakespeare In conclusion we have two superimposed ideas that never quite meet making this a film thats ultimately pointless Stand not upon the order of your going but go,0
I have previously seen Zu Warriors from the Magic Mountain In that film the setting takes place in Chinas mountains the Legend of Zu looks like another dimension Thank that to Tsui Harks extensive use of CGI effects Hes able to portray his vision of mountains floating above the clouds a land where beings fly freely and powers ranging from razor sharp wing blades split swords and the ultra cool Moon OrbWhile there are many characters in this one the focus is mainly on King Sky and Enigma The romance aspect is there although the movie seems much darker than its predecessor Cecilia Cheung is beautiful and her presence on screen makes this movie worth watching In the beginning I like how she resembles the Countess from Zu Warriors and she does well playing Enigma as she deals with facing her past life Oh by the way did I mention that Cecilias very appealing to the eyeIn truth Zu Warriors had more comedy elements and its special effects were limited due to its time in 1983 Tsui Hark takes it to a whole new level and sets a new standard in cinema,1
Tom Hanks returns as Dan Browns symbologist Robert Langdon in his first adventure Angels Demons which Hollywood decided to make after The Da Vinci Code given the latters more controversial subject striking a raw nerve on the faith itself The Catholic Church was up in arms over the first film but seemingly nonchalant about this one And its not hard to see why considering Ron Howard had opted to do a flatout action piece that serves as a great tourism video of Rome and Vatican City and would probably boost visitor numbers given the many beautiful onlocation scenes save for St Peters Square and Basilica which was a scaled model usedSo I guess with the bulk of the budget going toward the sets the ensemble cast had to be correspondingly scaled down Ayelet Zurer tried to step into the female void left by Audrey Tautou but given Tautous character then having a lot more stake in the film Zurers scientist Vittoria had a lot less to do other than just waiting in the wings to change some batteries on a canister filled with antimatter In the book shes the fodder of course for Langdon to converse his vast knowledge of the Vatican the Illuminati and the great feud between the two but here shes neither love interest nor his intellectual equalEwan McGregor on the other hand chews up each scene hes in as Camerlengo Patrick McKenna who is temporarily taking care of the Papal office while the other prominent cardinals are in the Sistine Chapel to elect a new Pope And he plays Patrick with that glint in the eye with nuances enough to let you know theres more than meets the eye Theres no surprises here for readers of the novel but McGregors performance here is one of the highlights of the film as Hanks plays well Tom HanksThe book itself is rich with arguably accurate content as always and had a lot more plot points on science versus religion and a wealth of information that Dan Brown researched and linked together in an engaging fictional piece of work While reading the book some years ago I thought that should a film be made of it its easy to lapse and dwell more on the set action pieces Sadly thats what this Ron Howard film did with a pace that doesnt allow a temporary breather Unlike the first film where you had the characters sit down for some discussion time over a cup of tea this one moved things along so quickly its like reading the book all over again page after page being skipped just to get to the thick of the actionCatholic reviewers have called Angels Demons harmless because I guess it didnt dwell on its many controversies unlike The Da Vinci Code which struck a raw nerve at the centre of the faith And if anything this film served as a great tourism promotional video with a nice showcase of the many prominent touristy landmarks that would entice many around the world to go pay a visit Naturally certain areas like the catacombs beneath St Peters Basilica and the Vatican archives remain out of bounds but the walk along the Path of Illumination now thats almost freeNothing new for those who have read the book other than to see it come alive but for those who havent this film may just compel you to pick up Dan Browns novel just to read a bit more about the significance about the landmarks and characters such as Galileo Michelangelo and Bernini who are intricately linked to the plot but much left unsaid Satisfying popcorn entertainment leaving you with nothing spectacular,1
I think I win the bargain contest for this movie since I got it as part of a Martial Arts Movie Classics DVD collection with 50 movies for 20 bucks which means I paid something like 50 cents for the chance to watch the Black Fist version of a movie that was released as Bogard For a basic revenge flick Black Fist isnt too bad even though it is obviously hampered by a low budget One of my informal rules of thumb for watching a movie is that if the lead actor is better than his production and screenplay the movie automatically gets at least three stars That is certainly the case here Lawson has some presence and some charisma and probably deserved a better film career than he got The street fight choreography the ostensible reason for the film really wont to impress anyone who has ever sparred in a martial arts school or even just been punched in a schoolyard fight I only spent about two years learning basic kung fu but even I would never fall for the front stamp kicks arm drags and roundhouse punches on display here But the atmosphere is good dust and blood and shouting crowds and the actors put some feeling into the fight scenes Less believable is the plot Dawsons character Leroy Fisk is portrayed as a streetsmart sharp young man who goes looking for work as a pickup fighter in illegal unsanctioned street matches Yet he is surprised and indignant when he has to pay off the cops Excuse me but I was raised in small town Iowa and even I knew from watching Hard Times with Charles Bronson that the cops have to be paid off for this sort of action and that the guys who fight needed the fixers in order to get their matches and that the fixers were worth the money So you have to watch this movie with a sort of willful suspension of your critical faculties in order to accept it as a black brother being repressed movie Most of the other nonblack fighters in the stable get punched in the face for the same deal tooyesThe movie suffers from a short attention span The director obviously didnt have the budget to film some of the scenes he needed so he had to fill in the gaps with some fairly ludicrous exposition scenes The I wined him I dined him and then I killed him scene just doesnt work along with voiceovers and montages that are clumsy and unconvincing This is especially true with the whole romance angle which seems to have been filmed as if it were an afterthought This is a little shoddy when you consider that the death of Fisks wifes death is supposed to fuel his drive for revengeBut once the movie switches all the way from young fighter rising through the ranks to the revenge theme it picks up a little steam and plays with a little more conviction Im not sure that the final payoff is worth the buildup Roger Ebert calls this sort of thing a long drive for a short day at the beachbut it does tie things off in a reasonably satisfying way If Sylvester Stallone had made this film with a real budget and the same cast slicker sets and costumes and himself as the hero people would have hailed it as the next Rocky which goes to show you how circumstance and chance can play havoc with wouldbe filmmakers dreams Worth seeing once for various decent shots and lines and to watch Dabney Coleman embarrass himself in a role that is beneath him,0
The biggest National Lampoon hit remains Animal House and rightly so It was funny raucous and goodnaturedThe exact opposite of every other National Lampoon film Including Class ReunionPLEASE do not be fooled by the inclusion of Stephen Furst Flounder from Animal House Or by the fact that John Hughes wrote this jumbled mess This reunion is about as hilarious as root canal and twice as painfulOne star and thats being generous Then again I always thought most of my old classmates were demons vampires and serial killers too,0
This is the first film of the Horrorfest I have watched and after Im almost thinking I dont need to see any of the others I was told its a thinking mans horror movie and have to say that if this was supposed to make me think I shutter to think what the splattergore films in the collection will be like Dont get me wrong not even the gore in this film is worth sitting throughThe plot is very washed out with way too much art for arts sake The camera effects and music are out of place most of the time and the characters are banal to say the least Several characters and scenes seem worthless in the end when they start to reveal some of the hooks of The Hamiltons I figured out who Lenny was about half hour in when I figured out the movie I was so visually under whelmed and confused by the Lenny reveal that I completely felt ripped off I expected what I got but they could have gone so much further in fact all the gore falls completely flat With movies out there like Hostel and Saw you need to come a little better for a film that is considered to graphic or too disturbing for general audiences,0
the movie is precious and cage is a babe but will anyone agree with me in saying that the punk representation in this movie is ATROCIOUS wheres the clash the ramones misfits social distortion the cramps sex pistols ANYONE the music is this movie is incredibly disappointing at LEAST they play the cureplus randys feathered hair and pleated khakisthis definitely looks like a movie about punks the way that a bunch of movie industry squares see punksalthough its a 90s movie SLC punk paints a much more accurate picture of the punk rock scene in the early 1980s just sayin,0
This movie is a coveted member of my movie library While not a mainstream film it is in my view a highly effective film noir in which Eric Roberts is totally underrated as an actor I would qualify him as a much better actor than his sister Julia who is overrated but thats another review Roberts plays the downonhisluck exreporter with the perfect mix of narrative precision and jaded idealism two ingredients that are part and parcel of any effective film noir The firstperson narration by Roberts enhances the quality of the movie and keeps us guessing on the real motive behind the crimeSet in Palm Springs everything about the setting in the movie progresses slowly as a metaphor for the theme of oppression Asch Roberts is oppressed by his past the police are oppressed by the rich residents of Palm Springs who treat them as servants the rich meanwhile are oppressed by boredom watch Johnny Depps classic performance as the insightful rich kid who only wants to be loved the isolation of each character is omnipresent and is further augmented by the heat and isolation of the desertThere is an audience for this film if theyre looking for a more contemporary version of film noir While there are elements of the film that might have been tighter I recommend getting a copy of this film and putting it right between The Big Sleep and Chinatown in your movie library The film is based on the Arthur Lyons book CASTLES BURNING and if you like Robertss acting in this one you may want to get a copy of The Ambulance in which he showcases his funnier lighter side BEST LINE IN THE FILM Careful Careful of what I shouldve asked Only fools ignore the strange warnings of trailer park ladies,1
The novel is easily superior and the best parts of the film are direct translations from what Greene wrote for instance the quiet but grim humour that breaks into the scenes with Boyer and Lorre or the murderedchild obsession that takes over some of the plot Where the film deviates from the novel it tends to the ludicrousHowever I dont want to suggest that the film is bad in any way It always looks the part and the story stays in the mind like a good un Some of the minor characters were stock actors who could turn their hand to anythingIts a dreadful shame that the films not available on DVD,1
I watched this movie at a Sneak Preview screening and Im glad I didnt pay for it This movie is just disgusting Its full of dick and fart jokes and takes no pride in the action sequencessuch as the shootout in Little Germany I made a little list of things I enjoyed in the movie and a lot of which I didnt agree of1 Dave Foleys penis 2 The fart jokes 3 The Poop jokes 4 The Dude was a pussy 5 No Gary Coleman 6 The Talibans 7 Again making fun of Bush WE GET IT HES AN IDIOT move on 8 The Dude has blonde hair 9 The Plot 10 The killing of minors 11 Uwe Boll was in it 12 Most of the cast were just outrages and out thereNow the few good ones1 The Dude uses a cat as a silencer like in the game 2 Lots of action 3 Crotchy made a return and a cameo of the maker of Postal 4 Uhm I didnt have to pay for it 5 There are a few what the ef momentsBoll did it again He made another crappy game into movie adaption Kudos to you Mr Boll 210,0
Yeah rightI spent the first hour waiting patiently for the movie to take off It was horribly boring and consisted mostly of people riding randomly around the hills with no apparent direction Then the hero comes into the picture Born as an Asian but when he grew up he became white Obviously white He wasnt even close to passing for Asian He looked like Justin Timberlake It was extremely distracting and the story did nothing to help the cause Pointless battle sequences and lame dialogue Its an hour and forty five minutes long and by the end I was trying to eat my own face I watched this because people at the video store where I work are always asking me if this movie is any good Now I have an answer It goes something like this ahem NO GOOD GOD NO ITS HORRIBLE DONT DO THIS TO YOURSELF I would recommend another movie perhaps one thats entertaining,0
I watched the 1st scarecrow movie and didnt bag out that one though i knew it was b grade it actually had some decent gore and the guy playing the scarecrow was an awesome acrobat and had some good skills going The effects were better and the costume looked heaps better then this movieI borrowed this one with an open mind i am also a fan of ken shamrock former ufc superfight champ and was hoping it was a decent movieBoy was i wrong the movie sucked the monster was pathetic in both appearance and in actually being scary the storyline was SO predictable it was like watching the movie in preview mode as i already would guess what will happen the music was so bad with a horrible lip sync song that made me wanna punch the screenOverall avoid this crappy movieSave some money,0
I made it about 8 minutes into Steel Frontier before I turned it off Then glutton for punishment that I am I watched some more the next day Today I had to iron a pile of clothes so I decided to finish the movie and that was its own punishment Heres what I dont understand Robert Rodriguez and Shane Carruth each spent 7000 on their debut features and created two remarkable movies Yet here we have two directors with arguably way more money and they churn out a huge steaming pile of crap Let me see if I can figure out the logic Its Road Warrior but its like a future Western Well get the cheapest actors we can find well have my mentally challenged cousin write the script and well spend the budget on a bunch of explosions We cant loseSeriously I dont think even the MST3K guys could improve this But if you insist on watching it I recommend getting very drunk first,0
The Contaminated Man is a good film that has a good cast which includes William Hurt Natascha McElhone Peter Weller Katja Woywood Michael Brandon Nikolett Barabas Hendrick Haese Dsire Nosbusch Arthur Brauss and Christopher CazenoveThe acting by all of these actors is very good Hurt and Weller are really excellent in this film I thought that they performed good The thrills is really good and some of it is surprising The movie is filmed very good The music is good The film is quite interesting and the movie really keeps you going until the end This is a very good and thrilling film If you like William Hurt Natascha McElhone Peter Weller Katja Woywood Michael Brandon Nikolett Barabas Hendrick Haese Dsire Nosbusch Arthur Brauss Christopher Cazenove the rest of the cast in the film Actio Thrillers Dramas and interesting films then I strongly recommend you to see this film today,1
Please Note I see from the various posts that there was an original silent version and also a sound version of this same film I saw the sound version and it was esthetically yicky Considering some indicate that the original version was LONGER and without crappy dubbing my review must be read with this in mindAlthough I know that Rene Clair has a lovely reputation as a film maker and Louise Brooks has a bit of a cult following as well this is in many ways a technically poorly made film While Hollywood had already pretty much switched to sound mode around 1929 up through the early to almost the mid30s a lot of famous French films were essentially silent filmswith some dialog and sound effects very poorly slapped over top the film The lip movements in many and in particular this film dont even come close to matching what is being said and this would explain why an American like Ms Brooks could do a French film This is just sloppy and I would have preferred they had just made a silent filmand as a silent film this is would have been an average filmwith excellent camera work at times and some decent silentstyle actingThe problem I also found with the film was the overly simplistic plot For a silent morality play circa 1920 it would have been fine but by 1930 standards the plot is a bit hoary that means oldnot slutty A lady wins a beauty contest and her macho fianc cant handle it She gives it all up temporarily but is lured back to the fancy life and this spells her end A tad melodramatic huh And also a bit simplistic and underdevelopedFinally the character of the fiancs friend I found very disturbing and unreal He looked like Harold Lloyd and spent much of the movie being abused and picked on by the friend and everyone else As he just took it throughout the movie and no resolution came about his character seemed superfluous and the treatment he received meanspirited Were audiences supposed to laugh as he was abused This seems to me thats what is implied and I dont like it at allThere are FAR better French films of the era Le Million La Femme du Boulanger Fanny Regain and others as well as better silent films I just cant understand this films high rating,0
Whilst reading through the comments left for this show I couldnt help but notice that a large percentage of the reviewers had either not actually watched any episodes of the show either all the way through or of their own free will The thing about Kerching is that its a childrens show FOR CHILDREN so obviously if your older it is going to seem cheesy forced and probably stupid I even found one person saying the sets were stupid but I remember as an eight year old wondering why Taj had ikea icecube moulds on his wall and also wondering if my parents would let me stick some on mine they didnt Yeah it can be annoying the acting could be better and some of the characters do really weird things with their hair but as a kids show I rate it 1010 Compared to the stuff they air in its place today well lets just say I wish itd be reaired DVD release anyone,1
Michelle Rodrigez was made for this movie when I first saw her in Fast and the Furious You could tell that she was a tough woman With this movie she has not only proven her acting but shows no fear and is tough like she should be in this movie She is more a bad girl and thats what I like about her This movie is about a troubled girl living the life as a tom boy and getting in constant trouble with school and family As she gets interested in her brothers training to be a boxer she decides to go after her love to fight and asks her brothers trainer to train her Even though they dont think she has the potential they get to be shown proven wrong I think this movie was a little slow at the ending but was well done It shows that people can do anything even if they dont think you have the potential I recommend it to be seen,1
Alicianne Laurel Barnett becomes a live in babysitter for young Rosalie Nordon Rosalione Cole who has recently lost her mother But Rosalie misses her dead mother a lot and continuously visits her grave conveniently located in a cemetery right behind the house late at nightwhere she also meets her friendsThis starts off good with a truly eerie sequence in the cemeterythen falls apart The story is thin and there is TONS of padding to make the film 85 minutes long The acting is terrible across the board with Cole easily being the worst Badly directed with some of the WORST editing Ive ever seen in a motion picture Scenes and sound are just cut off with no rhyme or reason Also the film has terrible and obvious postproduction soundAs for blood and violenceforget it Theres very little and what there is looks incredibly fake Ive NEVER seen such fakelooking bloodlooks like ketchup Boring pointlessa rightfully forgotten drivein movie You can skip this one,0
One reviewer notes that it does not seem to matter what Welles actually says or does he moves you I concur He was and remains a unique force in film More than a triple threat who could act write and direct he had a genius uniquely suited to film One can consider whether in an earlier age he would have been a painter This film certainly reinforces that impression A musician a theatre actor an heir to Shakespeare hard to tell but I am very grateful that his time cam with film and he have him captured on film I like the accent I like the face the size the style the mind and the games I love all of his movies and wish there were more I particularly love how other actors interacted with him on film Many were never better or at least somehow different with him because he was o firmly there Even towards the end when his beauty was ruined perhaps by his own intent he was impossible to ignore and he made every scene he was in Rita was a gorgeous blonde a Lana Turner look alike but perhaps even lovelier and even then the eye goes to Welles and one wishes for another minute another film another hour in his company That is why we all wish we could come upon the lost scraps cut from his films because we know we all know that there is not part of him not worthy of our time Watch it and be grateful for the chance,1
Im writing this note as a chess player as well as as a movie viewer I watched the 1997 KasparovDeep Blue games on the Internet I know something about the issues that were raised Other chess players will come along and want to know whether this movie is worth seeingbuying and Im talking largely to them However Ill try not to ignore those who arent into chessThis movie is about the 1997 match between Garry Kasparov and the custombuilt computer Deep Blue However the first image you see in the movie is not of Kasparov or of the computer but of THE TURK This is an automaton which was built in Europe at the turn of the 18th19th century and played winning chess against all comers I put the word automaton in quotes because it was as everyone now knows a fake There was a man inside itIf you dont like seeing THE TURK then you wont be able to stand the movie because THE TURK has as much screen time as Kasparov maybe more both in modern footage and in bw footage from some old movie The reappearance of THE TURK every few seconds underscores Kasparovs charge that Deep Blue had human assistance that it was to some degree a fake computer that IBM cheated that there was a man inside it working behind the scenes to help it win Not only does Kasparov believe this but the filmmakers seem to believe it too And so this is not really much of a movie about chess games or about programming chess computers It is a propaganda piece about a big corporation supposedly misusing a helpless grandmaster Really it is a lot like a negative campaign ad as it is chock full of ominous music and evocative camera work and spooky sound effects and innuendos we never found out what was behind that locked door and the everpresent TURKNow most people in the chess community are pretty much convinced that IBM did not cheat and that this was Garrys paranoia at work To start with in order for a human to help Deep Blue beat Kasparov it would seem that you would need a human who was better than Deep Blue AND better than Kasparov Since there was no such person the whole idea is a bit suspect from the start Furthermore by the time this movie was made there were computer programs that could run on your PC that could beat strong grandmasters Today much more than in 1997 we take it for granted that a computer can do things you might not expect And we are less likely to take it as a monumental human tragedy that a computer beat a guy in chess And in fact the bottom line is that Kasparov beat himself with two bad mistakes including resigning game 2 in a drawn position As for the chess games you actually see very little of them There are a few comments from masters and commentators that tell briefly how they went but really you dont get to see hardly any of the strategy or tactics at all Naturally as a chess player I take this as a major shortcoming but I think that nonplayers are being cheated too Imagine a baseball movie for example where you dont hardly get to see any of the game just a commentator telling you that in Game Four the White Sox defeated the Astros with such and such a score Nobody would make a movie like that But here for example we are told that Kasparov made a bad blunder in the opening of the decisive game 6 but we arent shown the position on the screen or told why it was a blunder or what he should have done instead or anything We just see a few seconds of Kasparov holding his head in his hands and then more atmospheric sound effects and camera workSince I saw this on DVD let me warn chess players about the DVD as well The jacket promises you that the Extras include the games with analysis Is this grandmaster analysis which people like us might find interesting NO It is the automated computer voice synthesizer analysis from some version of Chessmaster that tells you when a piece is attacked and a pawn gets isolated and that you are in the CaroKann Defense Main Line Blahhhh Someone might then come along and say Well clearly this movie is meant to dramatize the match for the nonplayer and so its unfair to be impatient with it But actually it doesnt do a very good job of reaching out to the nonplayer either it skates over some points that a true novice would really want to have explained For example it says that Kasparov could have gotten perpetual check in the second game but it doesnt explain what that is or show what it would have looked like on the board which would have been interesting It flashes back to the KasparovKarpov matches but doesnt explain why there were two of them or who organized them etc I didnt need this information myself but Im familiar with it If you dont already have chess experience there are places where you are going to be confused and this is just a defect in the filmUltimately I cant recommend the movie which like THE TURK itself is not what it purports to be a documentary but more of a stage illusion,0
This was undoubtedly the most disturbing movie that I have ever seen The first part of the movie though strange has a light and amusing quality to it The journey begins on such a peaceful note detailing and emphasizing the beauty of the hills of Appalachia But that is misleading beyond belief The obvious social problems inbreeding and the deformities of the countrysides inhabitants are only the first disturbing aspects of the movie I can still hear Bobby moaning in pain and I shudder at the thought Lewiss leg made me wince Yet while the movie was on the whole very disturbing and distressing it posed some interesting questions When is it moral or right to take another individuals life What can morality drive us to do or not do in some cases And are dignity and moral integrity more important than life itself Whatever conclusions one may draw from the film it is an achievement in its own right despite certain aspects that were chillingly real and gruesome,1
Poor Basil Rathbone an egotistical composer whos lost his muse Hes been faking it for some time buying his lyrics and his music from various sources Trouble is that two of the sources Bing Crosby music and Mary Martin words happen to meet and fall in love And then they discover what theyve been doing Complications ensue but all is righted at the endCrosby and Martin sing terrifically Mary had signed a Paramount contract and also at the same time doubled as a regular on Crosbys Kraft Music Hall Radio Show For reasons I dont understand movie audiences didnt take to her so she went back to Broadway and did One Touch of Venus in 1944 and stayed thereBasil Rathbone in one of the few times he played comedy does it very well His ego is constantly being deflated by sidekick Oscar Levant and again Im surprised they didnt do more films togetherAs in most of Crosbys Paramount vehicles no big production numbers but I agree with the previous reviewer about the title tune being done as an impromptu jam session in a pawn shop Good job by allA surprisingly original plot and great entertainment,1
I love movies and Ill watch any movie all the way through just to give it a chance I can finally say that I found a movie I cant watch all the way through The acting is terribly stale and monotone the CGI looks like a computer geek did it in his mothers basement with minimal software andthe long scenes of justwalking And this movie is THREE HOURS LONG I didnt even make it 15 minutes until I fast forwarded the DVD The scenes with the aliens are very short Ummm instead of naming this War of the Worlds lets name this War of the Walking Long Distances This cost 5 million dollars to make What they spend the money on the dramatic opening songOh but on a positive note one scene you need to watch is when the aliens first begin killing people Thats hilarious not because people are dying but because when they turn to skeletons they still squirm for 20 seconds afterwardSolike I said if you are a fan of boring stale actionless movies here is one for you DVD collection But I didnt write this for you I wrote this for the billions upon billions of other people who will HATE this movie It is not worth your time or moneyI know this is by the book but the book isnt that long and Im a complete book wormnerdgeekwhatever but why Just get the Steven Spielberg version its not all that good but its 10 times better than this I give this a BIG FAT ZERO out of 10,0
This film and its sequel Barry Mckenzie holds his own are the two greatest comedies to ever be produced A great story a young Aussie bloke travels to england to claim his inheritance and meets up with his mates who are just as loveable and innocent as he isIts chock a block full of great sayings where else could you find someone who needs a drink so bad that hes as dry as a dead dingoes donger great characters top acting and its got great sheilas and more Fosters consumption then any other three films put together Top notchAnd some of the funniest songs youll ever hear and its full of great celebrities Definitely my two favourite films of all time I watch them at least once a fortnight,1
This plot had more holes in it than an OJ Simpson alibi I noticed two Star Trek references in the movie and yetironically we have a lead character played by Andy Garciawho is the antithesis of the Vulcan philosophy of Theneeds of the many outweigh the needs of the few or one Lets just say that while trying to save his son from cancer he puts most of the rest of San Francisco at incredible risk Michael Keatons character is almost asunrealistic as well He neglects to kill at numerous opportunities and yet is angered when Garcia foils hisattempt to kill a bunch of cops at once The childs doctor remains in charge of her faculties even after beenheld hostage several times in a short expanse of time butput her on a wide walkway 5 stories up and she loses it Andy Garcias child is something of an anathema in thismovie He is the most sympathetic and real character one of the movies bright spots He furthermore utters a line that must have been the result of serendipity regarding fighting cancer that parallels Keatons motivation to escape All in all the movie was not acomplete waste see From Dusk to Dawn 2 Texas Blood Moneyfor that but disappointing considering the talent on hand,0
I havent seen BSG I tried to watch it once in the middle of the show but couldnt get into it However I saw Caprica Rebirth yesterday I felt a little lost so I decided to watch the Pilot today and I must say I was pleasantly surprised I think this is a promising show and the only side effect it had on me is that now I want to watch BSG as wellBut what I really liked is that I didnt have to be a hardcore BSG fan to understand whats going on in Caprica From what I have read in the net they were trying to reach the female population since BSG reached way more men and at least in my case it workedHowever I suggest that if you are trying to watch the show do it from the beginning starting with the Pilot,1
This one is bad A really bad and boring crime movie that has nothing out of the ordinary in it A series of crimes the killer that you do not see throughout the whole movie the classic investigations And also the classic tale about a cop who figures out whats going on and isnt believed by anyone so he has to fight by himself to reveal the truth Not too much in this one Vote 4 out of 10,0
I just blew four dollars renting this movie Why Alliance Atlantis would promote such a poor excuse for a film is beyond me But even more surprising was the reasonably good reviews that a couple of Canadian newspaper critics gave this film Im tired of our media justifying a film simply because its Canadian and low budget Its like they expect Canadian films to be lousy so they give it a good review regardlessNow about the movie The acting was below average with the exception of the lead male character who was actually pretty good The film quality was poor which I guess could be expected from the extremely low budget The script was absolutely horrendous An example is the story which revolves around one of the lead characters a female drug dealer who flirts with one of her clients so that she can recruit him to fix and steal bicycles for her gang whose only purpose is to randomly destroy SUVs Supposedly many of her gang members bicycles are destroyed in these activities I dont know how she cant afford to just buy new ones since she is supposed to be this big drug dealing connection from Vancouver to TorontoAnyway the point of the story which isnt revealed until well over halfway through the movie is that the drug dealer plans to firebomb buildings in the Toronto area to attempt to make houses more affordable as no one will want to live in the area Need I say moreShame on the Toronto Film Festival for accepting such a film Telefilm for supporting it and the Globe and Mail and Georgia Straight newspapers for giving such biased reviewsA film shouldnt get special treatment just because its Canadian,0
Ive seen this film literally over 100 timesits absolutely jampacked with entertainment Powers Boothe gives a stellar performance As a fan of actors such as William Shatner Impulse 1974 and Ron Liebmann Up The Academy 1981I never thought an actor could capture the intensity like Shatner and Liebmann in those roles until I saw Boothe as Jim Jones As far as Im concerned Powers Boothe IS Jim Jonesthis film captures his best performance,1
Crazy Six is torture it must be Albert Pyuns worst film Even Blast and Ticker are better I cant believe how boring this film is How this even got greenlighted I saw this movie about 3 years ago and the only thing I remember is how bad it was This isnt good bad movie it is simply bad bad bad bad bad movie1 out of 10 out of,0
Damien ODonnell has a good track record and in this film he handles a very delicate topic with sensitivity but manages not to let the film turn into schmalzThis is a fantastic film its funny with sad bits and it makes you look at things differently Tell everyone you know to go see it now FANTASTICThe acting is excellent and Dublin plays a starring role This film will change the way you view people with disabilities and also give you a very entertaining night out in the cinema I cant wait til it comes out on DVD,1
Cyclone is a piece of dreck with little redeeming value even on the so bad its entertaining front A friend of mine took the tape from an overflowing St Vincent DePaul clothes bin Okay that may be a little bit dodgy but it was meant to be a clothes bin not a crappy old VHS bin something the less fortunate members of our society dont really need to make their lives better It could be considered a mercy Watching a movie like Cyclone would really only add to their problems Anyway the basic premise of a woman with a superpowerful motorcycle that it armed to the teeth with rockets and lasers isnt even properly exploited The two high speed chase sequences involve vehicles travelling at less than hair raising speeds of around 40 KMPH and a superfast motorcycle that is in danger of being overtaken by a crappy old station wagon is not that awe inspiring when you get down to it There is only one scene where the bikes goofy weaponry is used at the films climax and it is laughably ineffectual or just laughable when it is This includes laser beams that look like they should be coming out of the hands of an evil wizard in a cheesy eighties sword and sorcery that produced large bursts of flame which seem to have no noticeable effect on their targets even when they hit directly The rest of the movie is just tedious hard to watch filler Lots of bad actors yes even Combs and Landau suck in this most of whom seem like they have been lifted from the set of a porno movie stand around exchanging really bad dialogue in a desperate attempt to pus forward the barely coherent plot There are a few badly staged fight sequences and some excruciatingly unfunny comic relief scenes with some cops and the owner of the motor cycle repair shop Comedy of the sub Benny Hill horny old man cant stop staring at the female leads chest variety Basically the money scenes involving the bike actually doing stuff are few and lame and the rest is clunky filler material Skip it,0
Based on the manga comic of wellknown artist Masamune Shirow this animated feature was a slight disappointment to meThe story is good but the animation is merely OK while it couldshould have been mindblowing The movie is IMO adequate but seems somehow flat uninspired if you know what I mean A wasted opportunity if you consider that another work by Shirow Ghost In The Shell is considered a classic in many respects It set new standards for Japanese animation and spawned among other things a brilliant series called GiTS Stand Alone ComplexI consider this worth a rental unless youre a fan of Shirow and want it all Do check out the original manga which comes highly recommended,1

This movie is an incredibly selfindulgent character piece that assumes that the mere impression of a story is as good as an actual story It was utterly painful to watch and had I not been suckered in to buy the DVD because of John Travolta and the positive buzz I would not have finished watching itThis film lacks anything resembling an interesting premise and seems to rely on weighty and frankly heavyhanded characterization There is one altercation scene between Purslane and Bobby Long in which a TV is destroyed that when played out is incredibly flaccid and illtimedI found myself caring less and less about the characters as I watched it It was probably very fun filmschoolwise to make it But it is just awfully boring to watch A indulgent and pretentious film school project you should not waste money on,0
I love Das Boot I hoped for something along similar lines a realistic war movie portraying soliders and civilians on both sides as real people with both the joy and pain of combatUnfortunately Stalingrad appears to have been written by a third grader and directed by a fifthgrade student Major pieces of the movie simply appear missing leaving it completely disjointed The dialogue in translation is ridiculous but appears no better in the native tongue you only have to watch the actors faces during the bad moments of dialogue to realize just how bad this movie is,0
this film is basically a poor take on the old urban legend of the babysitter who gets crank calls telling her to check the children she calls the police who trace the calls and find there coming from inside the house when a killer calls has a story so simplistic a little kid could have written it not much suspense it becomes clear who the killer is halfway through the film at the beginning when the first victim is killed it looks like a bondage fetish scene from a porn site or something whats up with that the film is oh so typical slasher fare with a plot about as original as a Beatles concert even by low budget slasher standards its cheesy dont waste your time with this nuff said,0
This movie was astonishing how good it was The plot is extraordinary and the acting spectacular At first I thought this wasnt going to be that great because of a summary but after about the first five or ten minutes of the movie it struck me that I was dead wrong I literally cried about four or five times in this movie and despite this I mustve watched the same scenes over and over again about thirty times in one week No the song scenes were not as awesome as they couldve been but the plot is what really gets you American or Asain I would recommend this to anyoneand I have now I guarantee that after seeing this one youll get the best out of it and its plot I hope you feel the same and write a rave review too,1
Non existent plot tons of poorly directed supercheesy scenes Snipers world famous sharpshooters who cant even hit their targets a few feet away plus whats up with the ending a bunch of law enforcers vandalizing a carnivals shooting gallery WTH technical mistakes how many bullets can you fit into a magazine of a glock 100 These people fire their guns without the need of reloading The movie is so bad that even senior Hollywood actor like Michael Biehn Aliens terminator cant save this junkDO not watch this movie I realized that I wasted some good 100 minutes of my precious life on this one Hopefully the director would either stop making movies or learn more for his next movie,0
iv been a fan of Rik Mayall and Ade Edmednson ever since i can remember weather its young ones or bottom and i just have to say i have never laughed so much in all my life guest house paradiso is bloody brilliant i know its not going to be everyones cup of tea with the vomitingslapstick comedy violence and foul language but then just dont watch it if it aint yours its not like no one knows what sick and twisted things Rik and Ade come up with when theyre working with one another i think its unfair that this film received such a slatting from critics becauseand i dont think Im the only one to think this this film is 10 out of 10,1
now we know radu munteans movies the excellent PAPER WILL BE BLUE and BOOGIE but its worth to see again or at last this first FURIA which shows perfectly clear his initial qualities its very interesting to see how his beginners talent developed into confirming him as one of the best romanian contemporary directorsof course the movie itself is excellent intelligent and professional script surehanded direction stylish photography definitely one of the best in the most serious and competent sense also munteans storytelling sense is compelling and gripping and he actors well they simply rock,1
This film is a study piece for my english class but its depth and meaning has amazed me Since were looking closely into all the facts and characters in this film its and interesting tale of love hate war and prejudice Well RecommendedStory A girl named welloff jewish Patty Bergen meets an escaped prisoner of war she then hides him in her playhouse in her huge gardens and as they get to know each other they begin to see the others qualities and they earn each others love Pattys father despises her and treats her like dirt Anton the prisoner of war almost blows his cover to protect her but patty manages to stop him before he is seen by anyone,1
So it starts with a beautiful old house in the country You have a group of people who get asked to come to this house and not surprisingly the caretakers always lock the gates at night for no apparent reason Anywhoo the people laugh joke etc This Dr tells them a spooky story of this woman and some kids They get scared they start to feel stuff Oh no a girl sees s ghost Some more talking then this huge ghost comes and etc etc This girl finds out that this ghost killed little kids and that she must free their souls yeah yeah blah blah She does but oh no she dies as she does And goes to heaven whilst this evil ghost goes to hell Two people survive and escape the house The script is terrible because a guy gets his head chopped off and Elanor the one who dies saving the kids says oh no The acting is wooden the effects are crap and the set is a couple off rooms used over and over again Basically if you like laughing at badly made films watch it but if your looking for a scare then definitely give this film a miss I was extremely disappointed when I watched this A very big let down My sister who gets sacred very easily got bored in this film it is appalling,0
Well first of all its not a bad movie It is good and I like the characters introduced I also like Lady and Tramps voices more in thisHowever I would like to see Lady And Tramp more I know it says Scamps Adventure and I love Scamp And Angel to bits but its a sequel to the original where in my opinion they should of just released it as Scamps Adventure not Lady And The Tramp IIScamps AdventureTramp did have quite a role but he didnt have much time with LadyBut anyway the songs are quite good and Scamp and Angel are sweet Ive seen better sequels but hey its not a failureI give it 710 Very good but still had flaws,1
This series has its ups and occasional downs and the latter is the case here Theres an agreeable amount of spatter with an inventive implementation of the Baby Carts weapons but the editing film is a seriously disjointed the filmmaking itself rougher than usual At times the action slows to a crawl as the camera follows the wordless wanderings of the cub who nearly gets lost early on All in all disappointmentThat said theres a spaghetti eastern quality to the music and action that may win the approval of dedicated viewers This installment spends much of its time following the minor misadventures of the little boy who begins to stare into the abyss of death his father opened for him,0
FOUR FRIENDS was first billed on HBO in 82 as a sleeper hit Having heard the term sleeper when 14 back then I was anxious to see one Boy was I surprised That film I hadnt really fallen in love with a nonspecial effects film outside of TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE much less a hippy flickbut having had grown up with a couple of hippies I understood the power behind Mr Penns film FOUR FRIENDS is definitely one of a kind The script is so personable and that cast Craig Wasson defines Danilo Prozor SO well He just personifies the writer type to a tee both smart and clumsy the scene at the window and strong yet so very vulnerable For me he captures what its like to be so taken with agirl that it lasts over a decadeand I have always found solace in the character and in the film Throughout the 80s FOUR FRIENDS was a partner in crime to me and I caught the movie whenever I could on HBO even if I had to stay up until 5AM And still always at the end there is a sense of loss when all those wonderful characters part from the viewers on the beach Jodi Thelen personifies that girl to the hilt it is so hard not to be charmed by her This movie really stands the test of time Every once and a while I check out my video of itor show a friendand it STILL gets a solid reaction Ive known women who absolutely fall in love with Georgia So many levels Just an incredible little 60s piece of humanity Very special very magical I recently found THE NOVELIZATION of FOUR FRIENDS by Robert Grossbach and its even more detailed that the movie Actual dates of events etc A real find And whats more haha I found the novel while thumbing around in a used book storein Omaha NE of ALL places Guess you have to have an eye for her When I was in LA in 92 working as an extra I went into a ruddy lil memorbilia shop and there were a TON of stills from the film Unfortunately I was broke and couldnt indulgebut boy those photos of Georgia and the guys all together just went right through me I met director Joe Sergant on the set of SKYLARK in Emporia KS in summer of 92and we spoke about FOUR FRIENDS very cool Alsoworking at a video store in Omaha in 98 waited on a female who was a relative of Jim Metzler Told her to pass the word on that there was some kid in Omaha who was just fanatical about the film and had gotten the utmost out of it Once again the movie captures everything thats in Danilos characters heartgreat great work one of mssrs Tesich and Penns finest efforts Steve Tesich is sorely missed An incredible writer Isadora Duncan C,1
The original exploitation classicthough far from enjoyable on almost any level concerning some guys who turn cats into human flesh eating monsters because the cat food they make is made with people is remade with scifi elements added The cats cant get enough and when the flesh tainted food runs out the cats turn on their owners Poorly put together on almost every level this is an example of the absolute bottom of the barrel material that used to actually play movie theaters in the early 1970s updated with alien cat and dog races battling for supremacy Director Ted Mikel is a hack but is so lovable a person I generally like the guy thanks to his smile inducing interviews and commentary tracks that you can pretty much excuse the garbage he mostly turned out Mikels wanted to make films and he didnt care how they turned out so long as he was producing something More power to him but I wish he wouldnt subject us to his home movies,0
This movie is so misunderstood it is not even funny If you think of seeing this one for the shootings stay clear This one deals with the effects and trauma that the survivors must endure Even the detectives are seeking the answer we all doWHY Fantastic acting from the two leading ladies as we see how those we ignore are affected by the very same things we are affected with Yes the language is harsh at times but it suits the characters well There are some loose ends left or unanswered but all movies have these The major issues are dealt with and this movie makes a major statement about how all of us adults feel after such major incidents Highly recommended for teens and adults,1
Predictable parody just about failed to impress throughout its looooooong eight minutes The only thing that made it worthwhile was the DO NOT COLORIZE line at the end credits Shame something more entertaining wasnt put on the DVD like Jonathan Ross enjoyable profile of Romero on The Incredible Strange Film Show,0
theres no one else watching the movie My husband and I went to watch it last night Its just a small theater but theres usually a decent amount of people there Not this time My husband and I were the ONLY people watching Dragon Wars last night Now we know whyThe movie was by far one of the worst Ive ever seen Yes the CG was good but that was it The acting script dialog directing editing etc was Godawful Since we were alone in the room we felt free to talk during the movie That is we talked about how bad it was that it reminded us of The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Godzilla Mortal Combat AND The Lord of the Rings It was like we expected to see Rita and Lord Zed portraying commanders of Saurons armyThe creatures were ridiculous You cant just introduce legions of dinodragonlizard things loaded down with cannons without explanation The Lord of the Rings has a wide spectrum of characters but it introduces and develops them over 3 movies not in an hour and a halfThe scene transitions are horrible I didnt fall asleep during the movie but even though it was an overly simple plot I found myself getting lost in the plot holesThe characters were caucasian Americans but spoke almost with broken English because of the badly written dialog in the scriptThe final scene that could have redeemed some value of the moviefailed Ethan didnt cry when Sarah diedthough he hadnt known her for very long during THIS life anyways He didnt seem too upset to be left in Mordor not knowing where he was or how to get back We couldnt for the love of God figure out where he was or how he got there either but if he wasnt upset we shouldnt be eitherOh and why did the dress that Sarahs spirit was wearing look like she borrowed it from Queen Elizabeth One more thingall 3 of the main hero characters were reincarnations brought back to finish the job Sarah completes her task and moves on to the afterlife Jack does this as well Then why does Ethan get screwed Hes left alone without the girl without a mapcompasshelicopter to help him get back Whats he supposed to do Send smoke signals And IF he gets back home does he just go back to his job He should have been given the same mercy of getting killed out of the movie that the other heroes hadDont waste your time or money on this movie We only stayed til the end because wed paid for it but as soon as the credits hit we were out the door,0
According to Lucien Rebatet in his Histoire de la Musique Robert Lafont BOUQUINS 1973 page 338 Beethovens character was not very compatible with women He had quite a number of Platonic Passions with female members of the Vienese Aristocracy to whom he dedicated some sonatas But Musicians even composers did not qualify for Husbands of Fine Ladies Haydn was a servant of Prinz Von Esterhazy Mozart died from drink or Poison and Bethoven was according to Rebatet a frequent customer of street prostitutes in Vienna A British biographer Newman says that Beethoven contracted syphilis before he was 40 That he became deaf because of that is possible but not certainThe Ninth Symphony was premiered on May 7 1824 in the Krntnertortheater in Vienna along with the Consecration of the House Overture and the first three parts of the Missa Solemnis This was the composers first onstage appearance in twelve years the hall was packed Although the performance was directed by Michael Umlauf the theaters Kapellmeister Beethoven shared the stage with him quietSo what remains of this Female Fantasy Ed Harris interpretation and characterization are quite good but too linear based on the Painting by Ferninand Waldmller date 1823 I have it in front of me It shows a man that despises perhaps hates the World With good reason,0
10 ITEMS OR LESS is one of those under the radar pictures that is drenched in the simplicity that most independent movies have honest ad hoc performances by its two leads Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega who establish quite a complementary if unlikely duo The great thing is this entire movie looks improbable despite its road movie roots How Morgan Freemans unnamed character psychically not physicallyarrives to where he meets this jaded checkout girl who has an unhealthy relationship with her current supervisor who also happens to be getting it on with her philandering husband played by Bobby Cannavale in a small role is somehow left for us to witness more than deduce and their witty banter two people on opposite sides of the coin of society is deceptively simple So in a nutshell while there arent any bang moments of Earthshattering revelations this movie is a quirky little mood piece that probably otherwise got lost in the shuffle of indies which came out in 2006 but deserves to be seen if only for its honesty,1
The plot of Corpse Grinders 2 is very much similar to the original Corpse Grinders what is left that is different from the other film consists of weird aliensIt is my belief that this film would be the 1 worst film on IMDb if anyone had actually watched it The plot is disconnected and in several way too many instances makes absolutely no sense whatsoever The real wonder here is why in the world was this sequel created to such an unsuccessful and horrendous but still somewhat better filmI would highly recommend this film if you enjoy watching terrible movies for a good laugh,0
A March 1947 New York Times article described Crossfire as one of the first Hollywood films of the 1940s to face questions of racial and religious prejudice with more forthright courage than audiences have been accustomed to expect While RKO was producing Crossfire Twentieth CenturyFox was making Gentlemans Agreement another story about antisemitism RKO raced to beat the much ballyhooed Fox picture to the theaters releasing Crossfire several months before Gentlemans Agreement In July 1947 RKO screened Crossfire for representatives of various Los Angeles religious groups In addition several surveys which were designed to gauge the audiences prejudices were conducted before and after screenings of the film Crossfire received both praise and criticism for its depiction of antisemitism in America and was the subject of many editorials Crossfire received an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture but lost to Gentlemans Agreement It was also nominated for Best Supporting Actor Robert Ryan Best Supporting Actress Gloria Grahame Best Director and Best Screenplay Adaptation In September 1947 Crossfire was named Best Social Film at Cannes In December 1947 Ebony magazine an AfricanAmerican publication gave the film its annual award for improving interracial understanding Loved this movie If you get the chance to watch it see it,1
First things first this movie is achingly beautiful A someone who works on 3D CG films as a lightercompositor the visuals blew me away Every second I was stunned by what was on screen As for the story well its okay Its not going to set the world on fire but if you like your futuristic Blade Runneresquire tales and who doesnt then you will be fineI do have to say that I felt the voice acting was particularly bland and detracted from the movie as a whole I saw it at the cinema in English but I am hoping that there is a French version floating around somewhereDefinitely worth seeing,1
Just finished watching cant say I was impressedIt starts of quite good the visual and the atmosphere gives a creepy feeling as this type of movie should But it all ends when the first lordi monster appears Not only do you recognize them from the band lordi but they are seriously malplaced in the movie Doomsday monsters with leather jackets and piercings are so 80sAs for the storyline it starts of as similar horror movies people trapped inside a hell hole But there is no clear story on why and what is happening The viewer is thrown some lines on possible reasons but the lines never meet and end up to anything but a messWith all the money spent on this film with an intriguing start and some good effects I had thought someone would have taken better care of the product I wonder if lordi made this movie just to prove that their show costumes could be scary except they arentSo the movie gets cred for the visuals i guess the money had to go somewhere But the rest is an embarrassing attempt from a rock band to make their onstage monster aliases scarier,0
Why me Why should I be subjected to such slaughter of what could have made an interesting plot At least if I can warn other people off it will have been worthwhileI had to watch this horrible movie for a college course Otherwise I would have looked at the synopsis on the back of the thing and steered clear The movie was slow had PAINFULLY little character development and centered around the idea that a creepy little white man can become cool if he hangs out with an LAstyle token black manIf you want to experience the stereotypical LA feeling of dizzying superficiality watch the movie Note though that this movie does not DEPICT what we have come to think of as an LA lifestyle it is a wonderful example of the products that ARISE from it,0
What Hopkins does succeed at with this effort as writer and director is giving us a sense that we know absolutely no one in the film However perhaps therein lies the problem His movie has a lot of ambition and his intentions were obviously complex and drawn from very deep within but its so impersonal There are no characters We never know who anyone is thus there is no investment on our partIt could be about a screenwriter intermingle with his own characters Is it Maybe By that I dont mean that Slipstream is ambiguous I mean that there is no telling Hopkinss film is an experiment On the face of it one could make the case that it is about a wouldbe screenwriter who at the very moment of his meeting with fate realizes that life is hit and miss andor success is blind chance as he is hurled into a slipstream of collisions between points in time dreams thoughts and reality Nevertheless it is so unremittingly cerebral that it leaves no room for any hint of emotion even to the tiny quite rudimentary extent of allowing us a connection with its charactersI didnt think the nippy and flamboyant school of shaky machinegunspeed camerawork and editing disengaged me but reflecting upon the film I am beginning to realize that it had a lot to do with it There are so many movies of the past decade in which the cuts or camera movement have sound effects as well as other atmospheredeteriorating technical doodads I suppose in this case it was justified in that its purpose was to compose the impressionistic responsiveness of dreams However I knew barely anything about Slipstream when watching it and I came out the same way And I just do not care because Hopkins made no effort to make us care There are interactive movies and there are movies that sit in a rocking chair and knit unaware of your presence Slipstream is the latter,0
On the 28th of December 1895 in the Grand Caf in Paris film history was writing itself while Louis Lumire showed his short films all single shots to a paying audience La Sortie des Usines Lumire was the first film to be played and I wish I was there not only to see the film but also the reactions of the audienceWe start with closed doors of the Lumire factory Apparently since the image seems a photograph people thought they were just going to see a slide show not something they were hoping for But then the doors open and people are streaming out heading home First a lot of women then some men and one man on a bike with a big dog When they are all out the doors close againWhether this is the first film or not some say LArrive dun Train la Ciotat was the first film Lumire recorded it is an impressive piece of early cinema Being bored by this is close to impossible for multiple reasons One simple reason it is only fifty seconds long But also for people who normally only like the special effect films there must be something interesting here you dont get to see historical things like this every day,1
After the atomic bomb hits Hiroshima charred bodies lie all around deformed victims attempt to communicate with relatives who cant even recognize them and one person after another dies of radiation sickness This black and white film however sad and scary is not without humor The story revolves around a young woman Yasuko who was hit by black rain after the explosion She is trying to get married but everyone keeps dying and people are worried the same will happen to her After finding a suitable mate who is losing his mind after being in the war for too long she ends up showing signs of radiation sickness This film is a great portrayal of the atomic attacks on Japan it will frighten you and will perhaps make you cry The acting is good not overly dramatic like many other ww2 films that have been made,1
Notwithstanding that The House of Adam is meant to be a mainstream gay movie that Anthony John Shaw who is gay curious and a major cutiehunk and Adam Jared Cadwell who is openly gay and a close second in looks that there is a whole minute of wonderful convincing and naked lovemaking sorry no frontal between Anthony and Adam 41 minutes into the movie that alone may be sufficient for many of us notwithstanding all that to which I give a thumbs up The House of Adam is a horrible movie by most any other movie making standard A big thumbs downShaws and Cadwells acting abilities are either sophomoric or else truly suffer from the bad script direction and editing or rather the lack thereof Their lovemaking scene is nevertheless convincing and may have more to do with their really being into each other considering the rest of their scripting and actingWriterdirector Jorge Amers Bonus Feature selfcongratulation as to his movie making skills is off the wallSo the script and lack thereof is a thumbs down Overall the acting is thumbs down with just the slightest exception for Shaw and Cadwell Alexis Karriker as Nina might have been the best except for the limitations expressed above Far and away the absolute worst and insufferable acting was by Thomas Michael Kappier as Albert Ross Anthonys father having not even of elementary school acting quality He truly represents a colossal casting failureThe actors playing the new cabin owners are worthy of truly bad acting nominations as wellIf only the production editing and post production were as good as the trailer this movie would have been quite something else The trailer presents well put together clips of scenes that drew me into renting the movie in the first place That and the hope that this gaycentered movie was supposedly prominently played and touted at gay film festivalsOverall the movie is a big thumbs downIs it worth buyingrenting and watching it Only if you have an irresistible yen to see the naked love making scene and a few minutes of semiconvincing dialogue between Anthony and Adam Or if you truly just enjoy watching bad movies,0
Id never thought that I would be caught saying this But I think Dog the Bounty Hunter is more entertaining than this 90s era cop drama Walker is very melodramatic and actually set a standard of the genre of High Octane cop shows such as CSI CSI Miami and so forth Im not saying all these shows are bad but they arent good either I like the karate chop action that Walker dispenses on the enemies of justice and the diverse cast of characters as much as the science tech of the CSI series But there are some elements that I hate in a show like this StereotypesCountertypes Thats right StereotypesCountertypes Unfortunately this is a show for the moderates of Red State America who refuse to part with the old prejudices of yore especially when it comes to crime For example there was an episode in which a kid with psychic powers ventures into Dallas where he encounters group of kids in GothPunk clothing and they start harassing him Now This is exactly what Middle America perceives the GothPunk culture I mean come on how often do people that dress like that rob and steal from people just minding there own business Whenever there are Blacks and Latinos in the plot its always about gangs in some impoverished neighborhood Okay Not everyone whos a minority is a desperate recruit of a gang surrounded by crime drugs poverty Again this is what Middle Red State America sees of these people Finally Why is the Trivette the bumbling sidekick cant you make the sidekick an equal asskicker,0
Can I give this a minus rating No Well let me say that this is the most atrocious film I have ever tried to watch It was Painful Boringus Maximus The plot is well hidden in several sublevels of nebulosity I rented this film with a friend and after about thirty minutes of hoping it would get better we decided to fast forward a little to see if things would get any better It never gets better This film about some dude getting kidnapped by these two girls sounds interesting but in reality it is just a bore Nothing even remotely interesting ever happens If you ever get the chance to watch this do yourself a favor try PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE instead,0
Absolutely corrosive Director Arthur Hiller and writer Paddy Chayefsky dismantle the American hospital system with this wicked comedydramawhodunit The hospital depicted here is fraught with problemsfrom protesting neighbors to irate patients to a potential serial killer on the loose George C Scott is the top doctor who on the brink of his own nervous breakdown gets involved with freespirited Diana Rigg and her wacky father Barnard Hughes Alternately depressing and uproarious THE HOSPITAL features some of the most acidtinged dialog imaginable note how Scott describes his love making session with Rigg It also has a lot of great vignettes Scott berating head nurse Nancy Marchand after one of here underlings accidentally kills a doctor daffy administrator Frances Sternhagen trying desperately to collect insurance info from a waiting room full of sick people Scott getting sobering advice from the hospital psychiatrist after telling him of his woeful homelife All of the acting is firstrate Scott and Rigg are dynamite and Hughes is a real surprise The movie is a masterpiece with Chayefskys script earning a welldeserved Oscar over such stiff competition as KLUTE Sunday BLOODY Sunday The opening narration is priceless,1
Happy 25th Birthday to Valley Girl Great soundtrack plausible story wonderful performancescaptures the spirit of the 80s the slang of the mainstreams and the outcasts A wonderful rendition of high school life and gritty downtown from a suburban perspectiveThe soundtrack contains songs by Modern English Felony Josie Cotton Sparks Payola Josie Cotton The Plimsouls The Psychedelic Furs Men At Work The Flirts and BananaramaThis movie truly is Romeo and Juliet minus the double suicide set in 1980s Los Angeles Julies dad played by Frederic Forrest Sonny Bono anyone is hysterical as a hippie idealistic dad who wonders how he sprung such a materialistic offspring Yet he doesnt judge ya dig,1
Not even lesser Hitch but simply a bad movie The cinematic equivalent of a dirtyoldman Ugly in every way unimaginative script static point of view putrid clothing ghastly hair unlikable actors and one truly gratuitous rapeandstrangulation scene The directors perverse sense of humor is present but it is not applied consistently the movie comes alive only in its cruelty The women fare especially badly Frenzy could be used as proof the director was a misogynist though a better explanation to me is that perhaps beginning with his TV series and Psycho which he himself described as an exercise in thrift an experiment to see if a television crew could shoot a passable feature Alfred Hitchcock had pretty much abandoned art and settled for commerce In Frenzy the great master seems to be bowing to convention trying to go with the times and give audiences what he thinks they want in the form of unappealing nudity nudgenudge winks and general nastiness I dont begrudge an old man his rest but I dont want to remember him tired and lazy and pandering time to watch Vertigo again,0
This movie is very scary with scenes where the Devil uses Gabriels horn to open Heaven and pull the good angeldogs out and imprision them on Alkatraz The devil sings and dances to a few songs about the joys of being bad and at one point eats a live ratWe got this movie free with a pizza You get what you pay for,0
I was privileged to have seen some snippets from Aardmans original run of this show in the UK It was always fun and always funny None of the charm has been lost in translationits as fresh as the people interviewedwhether some of it is scripted or not as has been rumored is beside the point Its always entertainingAardman Animations shows great imagination in the characters used for each voice the single aspect that I probably love most about the show and its concept the hostility between the pandas the porcupines discussing fear of needles the painting ape Regulars really grow on you as well such as the horse and donkey teens from Maryland most every married couple the parrots the insects and the cats to name a few and childvoiced character and Ive really come to dig the ferret Mondays finally become a day to which to look forward,1
I think Micheal Ironsides acting career must be over if he has to star in this sort of low budge crap Surely he could do better than waste his time in this rubbishThis movie could be far better if it had a good budget but it shows repeatedly throughout the movie There is one scene at a outpost which looks like its outside the front of a railway station and i bet it wasThere is one scene which made give this movie a 3 and it shows the space craft landing and taking off over a lake surrounded by forests This was well done but the rest of the movie forget itThere is another scene which looks like a engineering plant which i bet it and does not look like a space outpost as the character say it isThis movie is stupid has a serious low budget makes no sense and God Help Micheal Ironsides,0
WhoaTerrible terrible terrible terrible did I mention terribleYou can tell just by the DVD cover not to get this movie but unfortunately that wasnt the case for meWell someone brought this home for me to watch and when I looked at it I just wanted to strangle the person because they used my moneyI will certainly be taking it back soon but I might as well tell you about it while I have it in memory for I definitely want to forget itThis movie doesnt deserve to even be called horribleIts beyond horribleQuite possibly the worst film everThe acting was so so so so horrifically disgusting as well as the deaths being so ENTIRELY lame and predictableI didnt even laugh at how bad this movie was which kind of frightens me a littleDont see this film shame on you if youre even looking at this movie page and I have EXTREME pity for you if youre looking at this movie page because you think this will be DECENTFinal word YUCK,0
I am a VERY big fan of Jenna Jameson but this movie is horrible At the time Jenna Jameson was married to Brad Armstrong and he was the director of this film and Jenna was the hottest porn star ever So of course Brad tried to make as much money as he could off her by making this big budget porn film Now I know why they dont make big budget porn movies anymore In a fantasy world porn stars could act but this is the real world and they cant act Thats why there porn stars if a women as beautiful as Jenna could act then she would have tried to go into mainstream movies instead of porn Just because your beautiful doesnt make you a movie star A fine example of this is Traci Lords when she was a teen thru her 20s she was one of the most beautiful sexy women on earth She made her move into low budget mainstream films and couldnt act Where is she now I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 rating just because Jenna is so hot but there are better movies she has made then Dream Quest Come on Jenna we dont want to hear you talk as much as we want to see you have sex Also you Jenna would have a lot more fans and more money in your bank account if you would have done anal on film,0

I was really excited when I read The Canterville Ghost would be shown on TV However I was deeply disappointed I loved the original story written by Oscar Wilde and sadly nothing of that was transferred by the movie,0
After my 6 year old daughter began taking riding lessons I started looking for horse movies for her I had always heard of National Velvet but had never seen it Boy am I glad I bought it Its become a favorite of mine my 6 year old AND my 2 year old Its a shame movies like this arent made anymore,1
How pointless hideous characters and boring film Saved by brief sex scenes mad witch gorgeous desert island and Brooks body The plot is tenuous the characters are shallow and unlikeable Having said that I did manage to watch it all mainly because I was totally transfixed by the jiggling and kind of hoping that her character would come good in the end The film was well shot well directed but perhaps the casting let it down in some ways Disappointing Really summed the review up in the first line but this website dictates that you need to write 10 lines minimum It would be better to spend the time watching another film,0
magellan33 said You can only do so much when the two stars of the show can only be seen by one fellow cast memberI assume then that you never heard of TopperWhich in addition to the two stars who could only be seen by one member of the cast had a dog dittoThis was the kind of program that had Not Gonna Make It written allover it from the first episode it was like an arcade video game where you actually have to read the instructions to play noone well very few of us apparently wants to watch a comedy program that has a basic premise that actually requires thought to grasp,1
This is a fantasy movie for kids based on the Boggy Creek Legend although I dont know why they called it Return to Boggy Creek as if its a sequelThis movie has nothing to do with the documentary and its fantasy kiddie fare Dawn Wells stars as the mother of 3 children who get lost in the swamp around Boggy Creek with 2 other men and the monster comes to their aid Yes its very silly and the plot is corny but this kind of movie is perfect for the 812 yo group which it targeted Its harmless Grated kiddie fare and at least you dont have to worry about leaving your kids alone while they watch it Strictly for the 812 yo set older kids will get bored and think it lame,1
OK the plot is wait you got me there is no true discernible plot here just a string of optically fogged sex scenes strung together by scenes of photographers taking pictures of pretty ladies Sometimes a combination of the two Then a demon comes around kills the men rapes and kills the women and waxes poetic about the meaning of life Moronic special effects bad acting and bizarre philosophy aside you get what you expect from a film with a title like this I guess it would have to be someones cup of tea just not mine as I have yet to see a good Kazuo Gaira Komizu directed filmDVD Extras Subtitled Interview with Director Kazuo Komizu Part 1 Part 2 is on the Entrails of a Beautiful Woman DVD and Theatrical TailerMy Grade F,0
This movie could very well have been a propaganda movie for the North americian falangist party or some similar group The strong man Kersey places himself above the law but not outside the law and liberates upstanding citizens by killing worthless trash The only thing that made me think it wasnt made by the KKK was the fact that a jew starred as a good guy Try watching it again while thinking of it as a propaganda movie for an extreme right wing group and youll see what I meanIts a tragedy that Jimmy Page actually made music for this movie,0
I rented this movie today worst movie EVER It was a total waste of time and a horrible story The acting was horrible especially by the actress of Sai She was so bad it was ridiculous I cant tell if it was her bad acting or because the character was just that stupid in the first place I cant even get my mind wrapped around just how awful and pointless this whole movie was Im surprised someone even thought it was a good idea to FILM this movie and bother to release itIf youre looking for a good VampireHorror flick this is not the movie for you Move right along Its a waste of time and money Heck I wouldnt even DOWNLOAD this movie if someone PAID meThis movie is so bad it doesnt even deserve a 1 I wish I could give it a 0,0
I usually dont consider turning a movie off unless its REALLY bad Homegrown is a movie I wish I hadnt even turned on The plot is interesting but the acting and writing are too low key I didnt care about the characters Any movie that has drug use and gratuitous nudity as its highlights is not worthy of praise The characters spent their time getting high and believe me thats the only way to sit through this movie,0
This movie is possibly the cheapest cheesiest and poorest sequel ever madeYet it is the funniest and most idiotic movie by Disney and will guarantee laughs at the sappy stories and lame plots from start to finishIts a group of short stories that seem like bad fanfictionsSPOILER ALERT The first ones all about Beast and Belle being petty over a pathetic argument Then three loser new characters decide to patch things up by forging a letter of forgiveness to give to Belle Part way through this little episode Belle has wall eyes which made my siblings and I laugh so hard Then she and the Beast fight more over the letter and later learn the meaning of forgiveness How old are they Certainly old enough to know the meaning of forgivenessThen the next ones all about Lumiere being the worlds biggest dope when it comes to romance This coming from the man who could woo anything female And they make FiFi a psychotic villainess who tries to kill Belle and winds up getting off scotchfree by the end of it What a message to send the kidsThen the next ones all about Mrs Potts being angsty And the next one after thats all about Beast becoming overly possessive of a bird to the point where he just seems downright sillyThe animations so ugly it kills There are at least 100 mistakes you can plainly see and the coloring is awfulBelles a simpering sap who blubbers whenever something goes wrong Plus shes petty and very different from the usual BelleAnd the side characters are annoying I mean Cogsworth and Lumiere fight almost all the time I know they did that in the movie but it was overdone in thisBut the worst character is Mrs Potts Shes ruined in this I cant even describe it Just buy it and see for yourselfI give it a 110 for the sap but I give it a 1010 for comedy,0
I was surprised how much I enjoyed this Sure it is a bit slow moving in parts but what else would one expect from Rollin Also there is plenty of nudity nothing wrong with that particularly as it includes lots of the gorgeous Brigitte Lahaie There are also some spectacularly eroticised female dead bit more dodgey perhaps but most effective There is also a scifi like storyline with a brief explanation at the end but I wouldnt bother too much with that No here we have a most interesting exploration of memory and the effect of memory loss and to just what extent one is still alive without memory My DVD sleeve mentions David Cronenberg and whilst this is perhaps not quite as good as his best films there is some similarity here particularly with the great use of seemingly menacing architecture and the effective and creepy use of inside space As I have tried to indicate this is by no means a rip roaring thriller it is a captivating nightmare like movie that makes the very most of its locations including a stunning railway setting at the end,1
Lord this sucked Theres a particular sort of sexual revolution flick from the 60s that manages to confuse sexual assault with sexual liberation This film is an example I lost track of how many times women are slapped hit whipped or spanked in the film And then there are all the times that women in the film fantasize about being slapped hit whipped or spanked you know they want it right Sometimes it is ostensibly part of safe fetish playacting Other times it plainly isnt but you will wait in vain to see the heroine report to authorities that she has just been raped Instead we get to hear her being lectured by her rapist about her inability to let goEvery scene of this film reeks of misogyny speaking as a straight white married man in his late 30s not a teenage lesbian womens studies major with a chip on her shoulder lest you get the wrong ideaPerhaps the one good thing about this film is that it provides a stark reminder of just how bad things really were for women only a few short decades ago,0
I had never seen Richard Thomas play a bad guy I wasnt sure I would like him this way And I wasnt sure he could pull it off But this astounded me He sent shivers up my spine and caused me to take a closer look at street people The movie is engrossing and fast paced Bruce Davison is convincing but all he can really play is a nice guy The real talent here is Thomas The ending was a little clumsy but perhaps thats the way real people would fight If you are a Thomas fan you MUST see him here at his best being bad,1
Documentary starts in 1986 in NYC where black and hispanic drag queens hold balls Thats where they dress up however they like strut their stuff in front of an audience and are voted on We get to know many of the members and see how they all hold together and support each other As one man says to anotherYou have three strikes against youyoure black gay and a drag queen These are people who sadly are not accepted in societyonly at the balls There they can be whoever and whatever they want and be accepted Then the film cuts to three years later 1989 and you see how things have changed tragically for some Sounds depressing but its not Most of the people interviewed are actually very funny and get a lot of humor out of their situations Theyre well aware of their position in society and accept it with humorjust as they should We find out they all live in houses run by various mothers and all help each other out The sense of community in this film is fascinatingWhen this film came out in 1990 it was controversialand a big hit It won Best Documentary Awards at numerous festivalsbut was never even nominated for an Academy Award Their reason was Black and hispanic drag queens are not Academy material Fascinating isnt it Homophobia and racism all together Seen today its still a great filmand a period piece It just isnt like that anymorethe NY they show no longer exists The balls are still held but not in the spirit we see here Also drag has become more accepted in society for better or worse And Ive heard the houses are gone too Thats kind of sad I WOULD like to know where these characters are nowI know two died of AIDS but I have no idea about the others And what DID happen to that 13 year old and 15 year old shown Still it a one of a kind documentaryfascinating funny and riveting A must see all the way A definite 10 Wheres the DVD,1
Im an opera buff and operas are full of sex blood and death It may help to know the librettos of the operas the arias are from to really appreciate this film my mileage is very different than Tug3 I am a classical music lover and I liked this filmI loved Ken Russells Nessun Dorma segment and would actually like to see him produce Turandot because opera is supposed to be overwhelming truly multimedia experience but then I loved Lisztomania I love Turandot and knowing the libretto so well may be why I dont find this segment the travesty that Tug3 didThe Buck Henry Rigoletto segment is probably the most approachable for the average viewer they are likely to recognize the tunes and its a classic bedroom farce I like bedroom farces so the silliness didnt upset meThe Liebestod segment is so outstanding that I recommend people watch this for that piece alone Depuis la Jour was for me beautifully spiritual And the Caruso recording of Vesti la Giubba aka I Pagliacci with John Hurt as the clown was wonderful But people just wanting naked women may feel there is too much music and not enough bare flesh and sex,1
Some of the reviewers here have foolishly judged this silent film by politicalcorrectness standards of today Battle was an excellent film for several reasons correctly noted by more rational reviewers Superb cast lots of action innovative editing and photography Its stars were in effect the DW Griffith stock company and to this silent movie fan that is inducement enough to watch it and to enjoy it I saw it many years ago and just watched it again at YouTube that was a very poor quality print but coupled with my memory of a good print in a real theater I can justifiably recommend this to reasonable people and film historians,1
Much about this movie was beautiful The acting the scenery and without a doubt Aarons cinematography background showed through on the beautiful shots Definitely worth watching as your attention will be captivated the entire time and it ends on just the right noteThe acting by newcomer Jonathan Furr was superb as one would think he was a pro acting since he was born He has gone on to act in other feature films but this starring role will always be rememberedThe film does have that academy award feel to it at times where its slow and scenic and quiet so its not a movie that add kids can sit through However the rustic feel of East Bend and Yadkinville played out well as a 1940s era film,1
From what I remember seeing of this film it was not good I always say that if a film is good and can keep you attention throughout the hardest of moments example a Tylenol Cold Sinus war than it is a film that has done its job The fact that I was asleep for most of this film only proves the fact that it could not keep my attention and ergo it did not complete its job Why did I fall victim to the Tylenol Cold Sinus when I had a film in my arsenal To begin Committed did not make any sense The acting was poor and the overall story left more doors opened that just couldnt be closed I am thinking of the moment when I swear I saw Affleck and Graham brother and sister in this film kissing That didnt make any sense Then there was a scene with Affleck and his roommates indicating that he was sleeping with one of them almost breaking up a perfect lesbian couple I suppose this was to show that most are not as committed to a relationship as Graham is but for me it just was nothing more than filler I have this suspicious feeling that the director of this film was sleeping with Affleck His acting in this film was atrocious I mean I have never seen him do any good acting but this was by far the worst Oh I just had another moment during the battle come through my mind and I confirmed it with IMDbcom what was John Stewart doing in this film That was yet again another moment when my eyes were opened just for a moment in one of those battles that seemed to last foreverAnd frankly its Heather Graham we could care less about her after a while Shes just not interesting shes just bland boring and basically stops acting after a while While they desperately start throwing wacky characters into the mix to revive the movie it just doesnt work and instead of just calling it a day they start throwing more characters into the mix so now its just weird tedious boring and really really long Luke Wilsons slow drawl acting style slows an already crawling movie to dead halt why exactly were these two married Committed is a truly terrible filmthe kind of hip comedy that leaves you staggering out depressed and boredGrade out of,0
When I decided to try watching a movie about cryogenic zombies cryonoids I wasnt expecting a whole lot Thats exactly what I got and then even less Aside from a shortage of special effects squibs and a severe lack of any acting talent The Chilling also sports the absolute worst script Ive ever seen made into a movie I had to stop the tape numerous times during the first 45 minutes in order to repair the damage done to my intellect for witnessing such atrocious dialogue as there is found hereFurthermore the collection of characters is so formulaic and onedimensional its ridiculous the corrupt doctor his assistant played by Linda Blair we know shes his assistant because he repeatedly refers to her by that title the recentlywidowed businessman with a heart of gold who develops a romantic interest with Blairs character his criminal son the Blair characters alcoholic abusive unemployed boyfriend whom we are introduced to in the most contrived use of a flashback and of course the rough tough bearded security guard who becomes the heroApparently the preserving fluid which some cryogenics lab uses on its bodies is highly conductive naturally resulting in disaster when all of the labs containers end up outdoors in a remarkable sequence of events during a lightning storm on Halloween night no less As for the zombies themselves if you enjoy watching people in green latex masks walking around in aluminum foil suits then The Chilling is the movie for you The zombie action is very weak at its best the zombies primary killing method seems to be grabbing people by the shoulders and shaking them to death The businessman and the security guard do most of the zombie fighting including a highly suspenseful scene of refreezing the undead with liquid nitrogen Let me tell you the steel mill scene in T2 has got nothing on The Chilling in portraying an enemy getting frozen in his tracks like thatHow Linda Blair ended up stuck in the middle of this piece of dreck is indeed a mystery True her career didnt exactly skyrocket during the 80s sadly but this movie is an embarrassment for her The script doesnt even have the decency to put her to any good use The most that her character is given to do is shriek out things like Here they come Do something Hurry The only thing I can figure is that poor Linda was compensated for her work on this film in rations of food The hero is played by Grizzly Adams himself Dan Haggerty In this picture he faces stiff acting competition from his beard and the security dog and he does his best to outperform them bothThe only frightening part of The Chilling is the introduction which brings up the factual elements of cryogenics and suggests that the film you are about to see could happen in your own community As I was counting the number of times a few of the names are repeated in the closing credits I was floored to suddenly see Lucasfilm get credited Fortunately it was only for the movies sound production 110,0
I also viewed this film at the Santa Barbara Film Festival It was an excellent film about adult family relationships Paul Reiser wrote the film and included some similarities to his family It was funny warm poignant and moving as well as entertaining A film like this would do very well with the word of mouth reviews I would definitely tell my friends and family to see this film Lets only hope theyll have the chance I would rate this film as one of the best movies Ive seen in a year It contains no violence action scenes murders sex so evidently distributors question whether or not to pick it up Believe me there are people out there who would love to go see a movie like this that has redeeming value instead of the many typical big box office blockbusters we are usually given,1
this is a movie which reminds me of avatar starring rajesh khanna from the 80s the issue of parentskids divide is interesting but was handled in a rather unoriginal manner the characters were not developed fully and the kids seemed to go from being extermely loving in the first 15mts of the movie to being totally unconcerned about the parents this transformation was not credible to say the leastthey sld have explored this a little more amitabh and jaya were miscast as this helpless old couple firstly amit was not too convincing in this rolebecause he just did not look like he should be helpless i mean why not just go back to work where he is wanted instead of being w kids who didnt want them hema was not convincing as a 60 yr old either she didnt look a day over 50 then the whole isssue of the book baghban winning the booker prize begged credibility all in all a movie that handles an important issue but cld have been made better i give it 510,0
After seeing the TV commercials for this film I marched to my local cinema expecting a lot of laughs In the end it was one of the longest 90mins I have ever spent The Wog Boy really did fail to provide a story line with enough substance to hold my interest and predictable and sometimes tasteless jokes didnt fill this voidA scene where the two Wog Boys dominate the dancefloor of their local nightclub was the only one that impressed me at all The only character that was worth watching was Nathan played by The Castles Stephen Curry his struggle with the opposite sex providing most of the few laughsA word for this flic is boring Save yourself the time and just watch the TV commercial as the only laughs are shown on it,0
Ringmaster Jerry Springers pathetic excuse for wasting film that should be recycled as toilet paper recently destroyed my confidence in the art of film First of all it was made Second of all people went to see it Third some people voted it the best movie they have ever seen If a monkey could make a movie im 100 percent sure that it would be 1 billion times as good Most crappy movies have their moments even Godzilla had a few cool special effects this films moment was when I left the theater nauseated The only thing that possibly couldve made this movie any worse would be if Jerry Springer was the star If I want to stare at crap for an hour and a half ill take a dump in a can If anyone didnt utterly despise this movie I pity you and your children and your childrens childrens children however contrary to Springers beliefs I clearly dont condone children having sex,0
Seven Pounds this was the movie where I was just convinced Will Smith is really going for the Im going to make you cry films One thing I can give him a ton of credit for the man can cry My only thing is as moving as the story is Will Smith has proved time and time again that he can act so why is he taking this extremely depressing story But nevertheless its still a good movie I do have to admit it made me cry but I felt that the stand out performance was Rosario Dawson I absolutely love this girl ever since I saw her in 25th Hour with Ed Norton I knew this girl was going to go far Shes beautiful charming funny and talented cant wait to see how much further her career is going to go But her and Will Smith not so sure if they had the great chemistry that the film needed that wouldve made this into a great filmTwo years ago Tim Thomas was in a car crash which was caused by him using his mobile phone seven people died six strangers and his fiance A year after the crash and having quit his job as an aeronautical engineer Tim donates a lung lobe to his brother Ben an IRS employee Six months later he donates part of his liver to a child services worker named Holly After that he begins searching for more candidates to receive donations He finds George a junior hockey coach and donates a kidney to him and then donates bone marrow to a young boy named Nicholas Two weeks before he dies he contacts Holly and asks if she knows anyone who deserves help She suggests Connie Tepos who lives with an abusive boyfriend Tim moves out of his house and into a local motel taking with him his pet box jellyfish One night after being beaten Connie contacts Tim and he gives her the keys and deed to his beach house She takes her two children and moves in to their new home Having stolen his brothers credentials and making himself known by his brothers name Ben he checks out candidates for his two final donations The first is Ezra Turner a blind vegetarian meat salesman who plays the piano Tim calls Ezra Turner and harasses him at work to check if he is quick to anger Ezra remains calm and Tim decides he is worthy He then contacts Emily Posa a selfemployed greeting card printer who has a heart condition and a rare blood type He spends time with her weeding her garden and fixing her rare Heidelberg printer He begins to fall in love with her and decides that as her condition has worsened he needs to make his donationSeven Pounds is a good film and no doubt worth a look I would just recommend going for the rental vs the theater Will Smith pulls in a good performance but not his best just most of the film required him crying in every scene but the last one with him is a doozy But I loved the ending it was beautiful and really made you appreciate life and to not take it for granted There is still good people in this world and Bens character reminds you to value life and to give to those who are in desperate need Although he went a little far but it was still a beautiful story710,1
Awful movie Its a shame that a few of Flanderss top actors and actresses made such a lamentably poor filmThere is barely something changed since the first movie and the TV series same actors same prototype characters same scenario emotional complications the team under emotional pressure but everything turn out tiptop after a predictable grand finale Another constant fact in the work of Jan Verheyen is the exaggerated product placement company logos on the teams shirt and along side the pitch OK but two times a commercial by one of the characters about an internet provider is just over the topMeanwhile rumour has it about the making of a second series for Flanders commercial TV station VTM coincidental or not the station where Jan Verheyen is programmation manager since a few monthsTo conclude and the golden raspberry award for worst foreign movie goes to Team Spirit 2,0

I did not intend to write this review but having read the default review that shows up on this movies URL I felt compelled to write a rebuttal The movie in a word is superlative It does not deserve the slanderous review that the writer has written I think the writer has totally missed the point of the movie to a large extent In fact I too was turned off by the excessive show of Evangelist devotions that occupied the middle of the movie to a large extent However I must beg to differ with the reviewer in that this movie in the end is not a propaganda piece for evangelist action I think what the director has shown is that how religion is not enough to find all the answers how religion is to a large extent incapable of providing answers to basic simple questions that one may ask and all that religion has to offer is sometimes just banal platitudes of one kind or another This does not demonstrate a value judgment on religion as we have to remember that religion is transmuted and expressed by ordinary mostly well meaning basically good people and they usually have no monopoly on truth and thus religion can not in the end provide the ultimate answers to some questions in life Ultimately it is a matter of faith You have to take it on faith and thats all And if you are given to faith then you can appreciate any show of faith And if you are not given to faith then any show of faith is tiresome It is thus at the same time instructive to note the reviewer reaction to the movie In any case the director shows us that one can choose not to accept the religious interpretation of events and answers to questions and in spite of that life goes on and there are secret sunshine in this world that awaits all wounded souls regardless of their religious orientation And thats just the core message of the film Please note the last scene of the movie if you dont get this In the end the movie is a great one and very thought provoking and confronts you the viewer with questions that you have to answer for yourself Thus it is a work of art that is challenging to you personally I do agree with the reviewer in that the Evangelical stuff was a bit too much However given the above interpretation of religion as shown in the movie I think the director was trying to balance the act whereby he might not be called an Evangelist basher The actor Kangho Song was great as always Hes so balanced and just perfect that hes just amazing Hes my favorite Korean actor no doubt I know the actress Doyeon Jeon got the Cannes award for best actress for this movie However I did not find any specialty in her acting It seems that to get awards you just have to act really convincingly in crying and hysterical scenes and all All in all a great movie If you dont like it please watch it again and see if you get it If it leaves you dissatisfied or uncomfortable or asking questions then think if that was not what the director was actually aiming at through this movie in the first place,1
After seeing this film I did not want my money back I wanted my TIME back I wanted that hour and a half back in my life it was the most amazing hideous torture to know that I had squandered precious minutes of my life on this dreck I am scarred for life and ever since this film entered my life I have had trouble sleeping I am trying to suppress the memories really I am but they make me want to burn things,0
The oneliners fly so fast in this movie that you can watch it over and over and still catch new ones By far one of the best of this genre,1
This movie stars Jay Leno as a Detroit cop Tony Costas and Pat Morita as a Tokyo cop sent to Detroit to retrieve a stolen prototype of a car motor A Japanese man traveled to Detroit hoping to sell it to a up and coming car company ran by a man named Derrick Jarryd Unfortunately for him the men who were supposed to negotiate the deal killed him and took the prototype An angry Derek Jarryd tries to distance himself from Phillip Madras who led the men But Madrasplayed by Chris Sarandon has none of it and threatens Jarryd forcing him to continue their partnership Meanwhile in the same junk yard where the Japanese man had been killed a friend of Tony Costas was also killed by the same men Tonys friend had been watching the junk yardTony sets out to find the killer against his superiors order Tony is on robbery while obviously homicide should investigate the case While Tony is investigating the crime he runs into the Japanese cop and mistakingly he arrests him Eventually they end up working together on the case They make an odd pair and there are some genuinely amusing parts as well as some ridiculous scenes such as Pat Morita jumping and kicking right through a the windshield of a moving car and kicking Madras in the head But it ends up being an enjoyable buddy cop movie at least in my opinion Jay Leno is no actor but he is likable in the role and Pat Morita is good as well Still they make for one of the more unlikely buddy cop duos in an action film If you liked buddy cop films cheesy 80s movies or you want to see Jay Leno as an actor then I recommend this movie,1
What can you say about a movie whose funniest episode sees a fat man wrestling a garden hose The acting particularly that of lead man Jerry OConnel is embarrassing The dialogue is so contrived and unfunny it makes you cringe The controlling idea is actually not a bad one for this genre infantile teen comedy but somehow the director manages to make the least of it I rate it a 2 out of 10,0
This is a very good Spanish movie but I am worried that many out there will feel lost because many around the world have no idea what the Spanish Civil War was all about or when it was fought Being a history teacher I had a big advantage but could easily see how the film could be confusing until you piece together all the pieces I doubt if this would be a big concern in Spain where this film was made but for other audiences they may be a bit confused until later in the filmThe movie begins with 12 yearold Carol and her mother returning to her mothers home town Years have passed and you gather that they are coming to Spain from New York City Despite the strangeness Carol speaks reasonably good Spanish and much of the film is about how she adapts As for why her and her mother are alone Ill spill it now for those who dont pick up on the fact that Carols father is fighting in the war on the side of the Republicans who eventually lost in this very bloody conflictThe movie gets exceptional marks for its lovely camera work and music The rather slow and rambling pace isnt bad provided you are someone who can accept films this way I have seen several other Spanish films about this war and this compares pretty well to themnot better or worsejust a decent slice of life film about those who are left behind as well as a nice coming of age flickPSIf you dont know which side is which the Republicans were mostly Socialists and they were backed by the Soviet Union and Mexico as well as volunteers from many countries including the USA The Nationalists were led by Franco and were aided by Portugal and the Fascist states of Germany and Italy,1
Former private eyeturnedsecurity guard ditches his latest droning job and is immediately offered a chance to return to his previous profession His assignment to tail a mysterious French woman newly arrived in Californiaand apparently wanted by suitandtie racketeers Unsuccessful attempt to update the film noir genre without enough sting or wit or involving plot dynamics in the screenplay Director and coscenarist Paul Magwood who later claimed the picture was edited without his involvement doesnt give off the impression of having high regard for the 40s films his Chandler was borne from his nostalgia is appropriately rumpled but also bittertinged and somewhat indifferent The handling is curiously commendably lowkeyed and Warren Oates is wellcast as this 70s variant on the private dick archetype but the movie doesnt have any snap Nice to see Leslie Caron and Gloria Grahame in the castthough neither has much to do and Carons hotandcold running character is exasperating throughout Vivid cinematography by Alan Stensvold nice location shooting but it fails to come to any kind of a boil 12 from,0
This movie is like the thousand cat and mouse movies that preceded it The following may look like a spoiler but it really just describes a large class of movies There is the passionate wise main character his goofy but wellmeaning sidekick with his illplaced attempts at humorous comments the initiallyhostile but soon softened gorgeous lady who triggers the inevitable unlikely love story the loved ones taken hostage and of course the careless evil adversary with his brutal minions Everybody has seen tons of these movies already and National Treasure is like any one of them with only a slightly modified wrapping Every turn of the story was easily predicted and I can assure you I am not the sharpest tool in the shed I am quite tired of feeling tricked for money after exiting the theater from a Hollywood movie and if you have ever felt that way too heed my warning stay miles away from this movie,0
While not as bad as some movies like the horrible Atomic Twister Meltdown still relies upon common misconceptions and inaccuracies about the nuclear power industry to advance its plot I am currently studying Nuclear Engineering in the pursuit of a Masters Degree and it was easy to point out flaws that would be obvious to anyone involved with the industryRiding the false fear that a Chernobyl style meltdown could happen in an American plant the movie states that any meltdown even partial according to one of the guest commentators in the movie would mean disaster for the area In fact a partial meltdown in an American plant while destroying the core would not pose any risk to the surrounding area Three Mile Island experienced a partial meltdown and no radioactive material was released into the environment at all thanks to the natural stability of the fuel and core design used in this country paired with substantial containment The security steps shown in the movie were perhaps the part of the movie furthest from the truth At any important strategic location be it power plant chemical plant military base anything you will never see personnel responding to an alarm by milling around talking as if it were an unannounced drill This is especially true at a nuclear plant where upon the sounding of the alarm the reactors would be SCRAMed immediately shutting them off SCRAMing can be done with the push of a button in the control room you do not need to put the core in shutdown mode like depicted in the movie and the chemistry of nuclear fission prevents a core from being brought back up to power within about 9 hours of a SCRAM So if this scenario played out in real life the assailants would not be able to cause a significant meltdown In theory they could still cause a partial one due to residual heat if they exposed the core immediately but that would be almost impossible given the numerous backup systems present in a plant there are many more than the single backup pumps they speak of in the movieAs for the spent fuel pools it may be possible to turn the pools into a dirty bomb by blowing them up but this is far more difficult than simply parking a truck full of explosives near the pools The fuel is under approximately 18 feet of highly purified water The water cannot become radioactive no radioactive steam like they speak of in the movie Particles dissolved in water can but the water itself cannot thus the reason for very thorough purification So the only way to turn a fuel pool into a dirty bomb is to get the fuel out of the water This is no easy task as water is very heavy and the pools are below ground with very thick concrete walls The explosives would have to be in the pool below the fuel which is securely fastened And there would have to be a heck of a lot of explosives as water is very hard to move through an explosion Even if this were to occur spent fuel is not extremely radioactive and the explosion would not cause nearly as high a death toll as mentioned in the movie especially given the small amount of radioactive material that would be spread From a basic movie standpoint I grew somewhat tired of the style used The constant fading in and out use of gritty black and white and fast tracking and panning looked amateurish The characters were onedimensional especially those in the US government I have some problems with the twist thrown in the movie but will not discuss it as it would be a major spoilerOverall 310,0
Looking back on the year 2006one of the things i will remember most is the Snakeamania on the internet for a film called Snakes on a planeBut unknown to me there was a straight to DVD ripoff film called Snakes on a trainAfter seeing this i feel its at best a belowpar BMovieThe plotA husband and wife get on a train to go to Los Anglesto get help form the husbands uncle who is a shamanThis is because the wifes family do not approve of her marring himso they have put a curse on her that snakes will become herThought with a sixteen hour drive to Los Angles and a group of passengers the include an exNarc cop and some drug traffickersWill they get there in time before the snakes take her over View on the film First the effectsI have to say that while some scenes with the smaller snakes look good in a gorywaythe main effect shots you have to wait eighty minutes to seeAre sadly that bad that they completely kill any good memories of the filmThe film makes 198os Video Games look like T2 next to thisOne of the things i noticed is that there is no screenplay credit on the film and the directors make the film so anticlimatic it ruins the whole film Final view on the filmA belowpar BMoviewith an unbelievably bad ending,0
The most accurate description of how Billy Crystal fairs in My Giant is to say that this movie is to his career as Ishtar was to Warren Beatys it didnt ruin it but it slowed it downa lot Crystal should know the three golden rules of Hollywood 1 never play opposite a kid 2 never play opposite an animal 3 never play opposite someone that is almost 3 feet taller than you is as innocent as a kid and acts like an animalWhat is this story A comedy I guess but I didnt laugh except at the scenes where Crystal is on his own and not burdened with his whatisherroleinthismovie exwife or the aforementioned Giant Did I mention theres also a kid in this film Well forget about him The son is brought in to make us feel sorry for Crystal and we do but for the actor not the character Billy Crystal is a funny man If you dont believe me watch him in old episodes of Soap or Saturday Night Live Go rent City Slicker or Running Scared or When Harry Met SallyGiant is more hohum than feefifofum,0
Renaissance 2006 was created over a period of six years cofunded by France Luxembourg and the United Kingdom at a cost of around 14 million The final result is a staggering accomplishment of comicbook style animation aesthetically similar to what Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller achieved with Sin City 2005 but this film employed motion capture with liveactors to translate their faces and movements into an entirely animated format Presented in stark blackandwhite the film looks as though it has been hoisted from the very pages of the graphic novel on which it was based and the futuristic city of Paris looms ominously above us Directed by French filmmaker Christian Volckman in his featurelength debut Renaissance draws significantly from other films in the sciencefiction genre and the technoir storyline isnt something we havent seen before but from a technical standpoint it is faultlessThe year is 2054 The city of Paris is a crumbling metropolis filled with dark alleys and deserted footpaths the recent installation of modern technology merely offering a thin mask to the pitiable degradation of the darkened buildings The citys largest corporation Avalon achieved wealth through offering citizens the promise of beauty and youth and the companys research department is continually striving to invent greater means of eliminating the aging process Ilona Tasuiev voiced by Romola Garai in the Englishlanguage version which I watched a brilliant young scientist is mysteriously kidnapped on her return from work and so it falls to legendary detective Barthlmy Karas Daniel Craig to uncover her current whereabouts Possibly holding the key to the womans disappearance is Bislane Catherine McCormack Ilonas hardened elder sister whose trustworthiness is in question and Jonas Muller Ian Holm the dedicated medical doctor who adored Ilona as his own daughterThe eerie dimlylit city of Paris is reminiscent of Ridley Scotts Blade Runner 1982 and some of the technology looks as though it might have been borrowed from Tom Cruise in Minority Report 2002 which was coincidentally also set in the year 2054 However despite this familiarity Volckman has created an exciting world for his characters to inhabit Blending classic filmnoir and sciencefiction the result is an eyecatching collage of harsh lighting and dark shadows which I should warn occasionally becomes difficult on the viewers eyes The dialogue is a little banal at times and the story though engaging doesnt offer anything strikingly original except for the ending which I thought was a bold twist on the usual formula but Renaissance is intended to work best as a visual treat and that it succeeds in this regard cannot be denied,1
The movie was pretty bad Its not so much a script problem Its just that the movie is really boring in terms of pacing The movie just seems to plod along at a slow agonizing rate The story in San Franpsycho is that theres a serial killer on the loose who is killing morally corrupt individuals maybe I read too much into it but hey its my nature apparently after The San Franpsycho kills a pair of people under the Golden Gate Bridge were introduced to one of the main characters of the film Joe Estevez brother of Martin Sheen as a curmudgeony cop named Bill Culp Bill is currently trying to hunt down the killer seriously he doesnt have a name hes just The Killer and he is trying to coerce a local news reporter named Rita to help him with his investigation Bill is the stereotypical hardedged cop and he threatens Rita to throw her in jail for obstruction of justice Anyway a few scenes pass by and suddenly Rita finds a letter left by the psychopath Hes a cold blooded psychopath and she has a change of heart and tells Bill and his partner Joe about it and help them with the investigationThe movie tries to be a taut murderthriller but sort of just fails at that Its much like the movie The Black Dahlia it tries to be tense but it just is unbelievable in terms of that The movie tries to be serious throughout but it has scenes like where The Killer masturbates obviously a fan of gore porn what with lines like ooh blood on her or something to that effect and Joe Estevez hitting the table going Hes a cold blooded murderer I admit to chuckling more than once at the movie even though Im sure it was intended to be a deadly serious movieOne of the only positive points the movie has going for it is the fact that I didnt pay money to see it huzzah netflix And its sad because I could see some good in their movies after watching The Damned Sure the movie had its fair share of flaws but it was enjoyable Sadly though San Franpsycho has nothing going for it Granted it has an okay script its nothing too grand but it couldve been interesting Instead what you get is a murder thriller that fails to thrill or have even vaguely enjoyable deaths Also the other reviews claim that the movie has a great twist ending thats shocking apparently I was watching a different movie because by about the one hour mark I sort of figured out what was going to happen The ending didnt shock me in the least bit I would go on insulting this wreck of a movie but I dont think I will Long story short this movie is a boring uninspired thriller I use that term loosely that fails to have the Hitchcockian thrills that another reviewer claims to have a predictable ending bland deaths acting with all of the emotion of a plank of wood and a decent soundtrackIm sure others will try to defend this with the usual It was a low budget movie they did the best they could with such a low budget and all that other nonsense But when you get right down to it there was very little that they couldve really spent that budget on there was very little special effects work the soundtrack sounds like it mightve been recycled from Hood of the Living Dead or The Damned and its the same damn crew from those two films This movie really reminds me a lot of another low budget flick that was no good and it was called Mr Jingles the two are about the same quality they fail to deliver anything close to enjoyment and should fade quickly into obscurity,0
I always hated this retarded show I liked the shows of Cartoon Network like Dexters laboratory or Megas XLR But I never liked this piece of turd Basically because it have stupid characters the good or the villains all seems to be mentally retarded they have stupid voices specially Bubbles She is supposed to be the cute character of the show but she is incredibly annoying the story lines are very very stupid Some episodes could have been interesting but almost always the show turns childish and corny There wasnt any likable character the music was horrible and the animation is the worst that Ive seen Evena five year old boy could draw better I dont see why all the world seems to love this piece of garbage The Powerpuff Girls seems to be one of the worst cartoons ever made Fortunately Foster Home for the imaginary friends from the same creator was far away better,0
I have always had the philosophy that every single human being has different tastes i found this movie to be awesome and i think every college student out there might agree with me Notwithstanding this is not a movie with a plot its about real guys and some of the problems that they face I found the movie hilariousespecially the parts that they played the practical jokes on each other Simply put if you are in the same wavelength as these people you will find this movie amazing I dont think that this is going win any Golden Globes or Oscars or that the people in this movie will become future Hollywood stars but its a kind of cultclassic among young people who could relate to their experience For me the guy that stands out the most is Hans the Scandinavian guywho according to him isnt a looker but gets allor some of the chicks The littlepeople also play a big part in the movie especially when they are drunk If i keep going i might provide a spoiler and i dont want to do that just go and get the movie and you will not regret I give it a 810,1
Dont believe all of the negative reviews this movie receives Yes it is cheaply made Yes the gore is laughable And yes the acting is subpar However this is a textbook example of an early slasher flick and if that is your thing its mine then you will enjoy this one There are enough good aspects to this movie to more than compensate for the drawbacks For one the score by a then unknown Christopher Young is very creepy and accents the violence perfectly The ending is a welcomed break from the predictable upbeat endings of most movies And last but not least the setting is what made the film for me The makers of this film could have done a much better job dressing the set to make it more believable as a college dorm However if you can overlook this flaw the setting is great Four collegiates all alone in a huge abandoned condemned building just waiting to be torn down it reaks of possibility When watching allow your imagination to do some of the work and you may enjoy this film as much as I did,1
Talk about rubbish I cant think of one good thing in this movie The screenplay was poor the acting was terrible and the effects well there were no effects I cant believe the writer of this movie did Identity everything in this movie made me sick to start to finishThe front cover of the video box shows a showman with shark like teeth and scary eyes I looks like a scary villain but like the old saying never judge a book by its cover the whole villain looked like a cardboard cut out One part in the film a girl gets killed by a salad tongs terrible The setting was bad enough like they could of set the whole thing in Lapland but no a tropical island insteadI took this movie as a spoof which I think they wanted it to be but the only thing that made me laugh in a bad way was the tacky effects You can argue that I havent watched the first one but seeing this I would be safe if I wouldnt attempted itThe biggest joke in this movie is the effects the snowballs looked like they were home made and that carrot was a complete embarrassment If I would of guess the budget of this movie would of probably be between 8 to 9 pounds fifty The producer in a last minute panic must of grabbed the actors for the street gave them the script told them they have 6 minutes to practise these lines and shoot on a islandLastly the acting in the film was painful it was like the actors forgot their ordinary lines and made them up the way throughIn conclusion I give this film 0 stars out of 5,0
I have to hold my hand up and say that I was one of the first and probably the last to see this film Where do I start its a complete mess The main attraction of course was the soundtrack Which goes without saying is brilliant its what Himesh does best But as they say dont give up your day job HR definitely shouldntHRs acting is plain and simply awful Even if the film had a plot the thing that baffles you most is why this man is up on screen and what the hell is doing there Two words of advice to HR give up acting and secondly use chapstickHR has no screen presence no acting skills and the female lead looks just a little too young for him As for Malika Sherawat just the same old Bollywood vamp crap You can package the product as much as you want but if theres no substance it wont hold Dont waste your money,0
This was the first Ewan McGregor movie I ever saw outside of Star Wars Since then I have become a very big Ewan McGregor fan but I still cant bring myself to forgive this movies existenceMy sister has always been a huge Jane Austen fan and because of that I have been subjected to various of the classics Emma being one of them Ive always considered them irritating stupid and boring However after watching this terrible rendition I was forced to admit that the original Emma was delightful and charming Ewan McGregor scarcely serves a purpose in this film after they hacked and mutilated the part of Frank Churchill Gweneth Paltrow is ridiculous in an already ridiculous character and the rest of the film is unremarkable and stupidMy recommendation to anybody who is remotely interested in English period drama go see the originals If youre a Ewan McGregor fan believe me by skipping this film you havent missed anything but five minutes collective of him in a silly hat and a bad haircut,0
I dont know if Id consider it a masterpiece of not but its damn near close its extremely well made artistic suspenseful intricately plotted thematically challenging and full of bleak foreshadowing and sexualreligious imagery Theres also some great camerawork from Jan de Bont an atmospheric score from Loek Dikker and outstanding acting from Jeroen Krabb and Rene Soutendijk the latter giving one of the most sneaky subtle femme fatale performance Ive ever seen Like many other European movies this movie has an unashamed nonjudgmental attitude toward sex nudity and the complexities of sexuality and has zero reservations about mixing it all up with religious andor surrealistic some would say blasphemous images In other words if you cant bear the thought of seeing a lustdriven homosexual envisioning the object of his carnal desire as Jesus crucified on the cross before the two of them go at it inside a cemetery crypt then this might not be the movie for you What surprised me more is how this bizarre movie managed to completely dodge being a pretentious mess It mixes the abstractsurrealparallel fantasyreality scenes and somehow makes it all work Like any good mystery you can see the pieces slowly falling into place as the movie progresses There is NOT an outofleftfield resolution here The movie has direction theres no needless filler and once it concludes you begin to understand the purpose of what may have confused you earlier If you like the work of Ken Russell and David Lynch I can almost guarantee you will love this movie Hell if you have no idea who they even are you still might like itIm not going to spoil the plot by getting too detailed but the films opening shot through a web as a spider catches its prey sets the stage as Krabb as unshaven smug bisexual writer Gerard Reve interestingly also the name of the writer whose novel this is based on crosses paths with a wealthy mysterious sexy woman named Christine Soutendijk melding androgynous stylings with Simone Simonlike innocencecuteness thats pretty unnerving who may be a literal black widow responsible for the deaths of her three previous husbands The two become lovers and move in with one another but were led to believe through Christines bizarre behavior and the frequent appearances of another woman played by Geert de Jong who may or may not actually exist something terrible is boiling under the surface When another of Christines lovers the young and beautiful Herman Thom Hoffman shows up at the house things take an unexpected turn And thats all you need to knowTHE 4TH MAN was a huge arthouse success in much of the world but didnt make it over to the US until 1984 where it was awarded the Best Foreign Film of the year from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association The most common video is the Media release which has been horribly dubbed Try to avoid that one and head straight for the newer subtitled Anchor Bay DVD release Since coming to America Verhoevens career has had its ups and downs He has made a few decent films Flesh Blood RoboCop and some lousy ones Showgirls In fact Verhoevens big hit Basic Instinct is almost like a less interesting junior league version of The Fourth Man Soutendjik also tried her hand at acting in America and since GRAVE SECRETS 1989 and EVE OF DESTRUCTION 1991 were the best offers she was getting she headed right back home to the Netherlands,1

Tremendous fun both as a film and as an excuse to sit back and play the oh thats whassis name game Every star of the golden age of English films seems to be in this one and it was a joy to see them And the greatest of them all Richard Wattis was as tremendous as ever There is actually a plot that trundles along very nicely theres also some splendid jokes and comedic moments but the key to this films triumph is the characters within it Alastair Sim is magnificent and somehow convinces you that a six foot bigboned Scotsman could be the headmistress of a girls boarding school George Cole Beryl Reid and Irene Handl all have their moments but with Alastair and Richard the star of the show is Joyce Grenfell She is an absolute oneoff and brings a smile whenever shes on the screenher rollingwalk and plum accent done to perfection And for those playing the thats whassis name game you can even spot Arthur Mullard Barbara Windsor and Ronald Searle if you look carefully,1
Yes MTV there really is a way to market Daria What started as a clever teenage angstcomment on everything that sucks and make the viewer feel better about their sucky teenage life sitcom now mutated into a how you should deal with your problemscharade I used to watch Daria all the time and loved it Now sitting here after watching the so called movie I can only wonder what the point of this all was Daria tells us how to lead out life in college Excuse me didnt the point Daria made every episode that what you like to do is ok as long as it is ok with yourself no matter what the rest of the sick sad world thinks of it This entire thing reminded me of the scene in Reality Bites the movie channel shows the documentry for the first time,0
How many monster tree movies can you see in a lifetimeWell Ill go out on a limb and say oneThis movie is better watched late at nightwith a 12 pack of beer the sound off and you and your friends making up the dialogueOn a Pacific Island a young man is sentenced to death for consorting with the evil AmericansSeems his loving wife has been sleeping with the witch doctor and they set him up to die so the doc can be kingWell he vows to come back and wreak revengeBefore you can shake a stick the goofy natives run to the American scientists hut screamingTobanga comeIt seems the young corpse has done just that as Tobanga the walking tree monster Yes his revenge is terrible and so is this movieIt seems that these natives cannot run from a lumbering tree so he tosses them in quicksandrolls them down hills etcPretty soon the new king wants to trade his woman or kingdom for an axe or a chainsawGeneral problems with this movie are numerous The comedy relief is an obnoxious woman with a Cockney accent like this movie needs comedyYou want her to die upon her first appearanceThe leading lady is whinyThe leading man is a boorThe acting is wooden pun intendedThe dialogue is stiff and lumberingThe natives have Brooklyn accentsThe monster suit is pure gigglesWhile this is a bad movie it still is fun to watchIt gets a 3 on unintentional laughs aloneYour dog may rate it just a bit higher but only if the tree wasnt mobile,0
As the celebration of Christmas has evolved through the years whether one concentrates on the religious or the secular traditions it is a time when people are supposed to behave a little better to each other That has somehow slipped past one Ebenezer Scrooge merchant and money lender in 19th century LondonAs his nephew points out to his uncle he doesnt keep Christmas in any way because Scrooge feels the whole thing is humbug The humanity in Scrooge was driven out long ago hes a hard case a whole lot like his 20th Century counterpart Mr Potter of Bedford Falls New YorkBut as Charles Dickens told this tale redemption is not too late for any of us and a lonely ghost and three spirits visit Scrooge and show him howA Christmas Carol is such a timeless holiday classic that we sometimes forget that it is as much a social commentary of 19th century Great Britain as Oliver Twist was The characters in this film are middle and lower class The Cratchits are a couple of rungs above the street people in Oliver Twist but they are having to struggle to stay up there Still love and happiness radiate their home no thanks to the guy Bob Cratchit works for Like George Bailey who did a whole lot of good in his life and just had to be reminded how much Ebenezer Scrooge needed a wake up call as to the potentiality he still had for doing some good in this old worldPatrick Stewart in his live performances and filmed play has pretty much taken over the part of Scrooge But George C Scott captures the old miser pretty well in this film The meanness of him but with a trace of sadness that makes us root for him to change Scott joins a fine tradition of people like Reginald Owen and Alastair Sim whove both done great interpretations of ScroogeAmong the supporting roles I particularly enjoyed David Warner as Bob Cratchit and Edward Woodward as a hearty and stern spirit of Christmas present According to IMDb this is one of 32 versions of A Christmas Carol made that they have archived and it is one of the best,1
This movie is Great It touched my stone cold heart I couldnt relate about the racial discrimination that Antwone has experienced because Im living in my own country I guess it is really hard to be discriminatedWe watched this film in our sociology class in New Era Universityand I didnt knew that It was a true story I thought it was just created by an intellectual who want to bring a fresh air in the industry It is very goodThe part that shocked me was when Nadine abused Antwone who was just six sexually If I were on his shoes I could have jumped a tenstory high building I salute him for he being so strongThe scene that touched me here is when Antwone finally saw his mother Eva face to face He did not bitched her or whateverinstead he told her about the achievements that he got within the long years that they have been separated I think Ill do that when I get the chance of tracing my roots,1
A very straight nice old lady desperate for money to save her house and possessions grows pot in her house smokes it with a few oldbiddy friends and then sells it Thats the story for this lowkey comedy emphasizing the absurdity of the situation and some of the humor the predicament brings For much of the film it works The humor isnt of the laughoutloud variety but it does keep you entertained for an houranda half so I guess it serves its purposeThere ARE funny moments and Brenda Blethyn is fun to watch in the lead role But the ending really ruined a cute movie with insultinglybad messages that only the ultraliberals of the film world would like to see happenLike most people I would prefer a happy ending too but it should not all warm and fuzzy for those who blatantly break the law Also in here are the typical 1 children out of wedlock but that poses no problem and is deemed okay 2 clerics portrayed as morally weak people and 3 even a medical doctor who gets stoned too Hello And reviewers here blast Hollywood This is exhibit A how a secular society has lowered the standards in the UK and Europe in general Hey people at least have a trace of morality instead of nothing but a Timothy Leary If it feels good do it message,0
Who ever put that review as of bad taste is not all quite there its so funny genius and fantastic you could watch it until your eyes are square not to mention the rest of the work he has done on the rest of the seriesall is as good as Morris standards if you think that it is awful distasteful or sick then i can only think of one thing to say to you go to hell thanks it had to be said i think that the way that so many people complaining was a complete jokei would like to make a shout out to all the people that actually did that havent you got anything better to do with your time what are you trying to prove thanks for reading my heartfilled review on the mattercheers,1
Has this ever happened to you I go into my local video store and see a few new arrivals in the film noir section I spy a copy of a new arrival of a film I have never seen called NAKED ALIBI Its from one of those mail order video companies that offers mostly dupey looking copies of hard to find titles The description on the box sounds good The film has players I like Sterling Hayden Gloria Grahame and Gene Barry So I take it home and watch it About ten minutes into this film I started having second thoughts About half way through this film I started to dislike it By the time the film ended I not only disliked it I despised it The film opens with cops questioning Al Willis on suspicion of robbery Other than being drunk the police have nothing on him When he pushes a cop and demands to be allowed to go home the cops beat him up Detective Conroy arrives lets the cops finish the beating and then announces Willis is in the clear Willis swears he will get revenge Later one of the police officers is shot dead With no evidence other that Willis is sore about the beating Conroy make Willis his sole suspect despite the fact that his boss names a pair of mobsters as suspects Conroy arrests him but for lack evidence Willis is released The next day two more cops are killed by a bomb This time Conroy goes to the Bakery that Willis owns and tries to beat a confession out of him Conroy doesnt know it but a local newsman whose paper has been accusing Conroys department of police brutality snaps a picture of Conroy trying strangle Willis and Conroy is fired But Conroy continues his pursuit and Willis flees to Mexico where Willis has a mistress Conroy manages to convince his mistress who Willis treats rather rough to help him prove Willis is a killer What this film lacks is a convincing script The script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed Things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it Other than the fact that Willis likes to tip a glass now and than there is nothing in the early part of the film to make us think that he is a crazy killer that cheats on his wife He treats his wife his kid and employees well Early in the film one gets the impression that its Conroy is the one whose is a loose cannon He seems to casually approve of police brutality Conroy for no reason is convinced from the very start Willis has criminal past He seems to operate on the motto of the old Communist Bulgarian secret police Everyone is guilty of something we just have not found out about it yet Later Conroy shows kindness to Als mistress and young son now we are supposed to like him Sorry The early impression I got of Conroy stuck with me too long And he is also a dumb cop Only after he is fired and goes to Mexico does he run a background check on Willis and discovers that a warrant is out for him issued in Maryland Why didnt he think of this before Because this film hadnt used up enough running time The cast is good Gene Barry does well considering how poorly conceived his role of Al Willis is Im big fan of 40s and 50s crime thrillers but not only did I not think this film was good it left a bad taste in my mouth something many modern films do but older films rarely do,0
If you enjoy seeing what must have started as a 2 hour movie in unconnected bursts of unwatchability youll love this film Otherwise youll just wonder how they could have made such a film from something so simple to translate to the big screen as Inspector GadgetIn the previews for the film many scenes were shown which were not in the film and within the film some scenes just dont make sense While the movie is slightly less than 1 hour and a half I can only think of one truly memorable moment and that is just before or during the credits,0
I watched this because I thought there were going to be a lot of car chases and cool cars to gawk at Guess I was lied to This movie is very boringThe movie starts out Kip RainesGiovanni Ribisi sitting outside a Porsche dealership checking to see if they have the right car When they confirm its the right one Kip gets a brick out of the trunk and chucks it at the window shattering it He gets the Porsche while his friend gets the keys They start up the car and take off into the night They deliver it to a warehouse only to have been followed by the police So the whole crew ditches all the cars and go their separate ways Then we get a glimpse of Memphis Raines He is giving a little speech to a bunch of kids at a gokart track Then he is confronted by Atlee JacksonWill Patton Atlee tells Memphis that his brother Kip is in deep bleep Memphis is known as one of the most notorious car thieves in Los Angeles Memphis heads to a junkyard and meets Raymond CalitriChristopher Ecclesten This guy threatens to kill Kip if Memphis doesnt deliver 50 cars within 72 hoursThere are a few problems with this film 1Story The first 48 inmovie hours take place when Cage and Duvall are looking for a crew and planning everything out The last 12 inmovie hours are a waste 2 The Cars You see maybe 10 cars out of the 50 as the movie advertises So where are the other 40 cars Why dont we get to see them 3 The Chase The chase at the end of the movie was a joke It was not suspenseful at all4 The Dog Somewhere in the movie the dog eats the burgers and swallows three keys as well This is impossible The keys were flipped open The keys would have severely damaged the dogs esophagus stomach and large intestines The guys suggest giving the dog laxatives to help him poop it out This wont work The dog will get a lot of diarrhea but no keys It was stated in Jackass after Ryan Dunne stuck a toy car up his rectum Take laxatives lots of diarrhea but no car Same case with the dog5 The Cop During The Chase When Eleanor breaks down for a few minutes Nicholas Cage tries desperately to start up the car You see a police cruiser behind him who isnt looking at his car at all But right when Nicholas Cage starts the engine up again the police officer jerks his head to the right sees the car and immediately begins to chase after him It is stupid So right when he heard the engine start and saw the car he knew that was the car he was looking for How does he know its the right car He only sees the back of itOverall the movie is boring There is no action There are very few cars The movie is stupid I have never seen the original but I plan toI give this movie 1 star out of 10 Get The Fast and Furious instead,0
I couldnt bear to sit through he entire movie Do families like this really exist somewhere There have been many comments describing this family as akin to LLBean models and such and I think that that is a great description of how they behavedMore absurdly unbelievable writingacting occurs as we meet a character referred to in High School as pigface who of course has grown into a dropdead gorgeous 20year Harvardeducated plastic surgeon but only to do good in the worldnot for the money and she beds Steve Carrel on the first date Thats when I quit watchingIf you can completely suspend your disbelief for two hours then perhaps youll enjoy this sentimental selfindulgent waste of time,0
One of the best movies ever the idea of a double interpretation involves we all Would be Prot a schizophrenic or an ET No doubt in my opinion but lets keep the question open Kevin Spacey the big screen monster plays Prot as it should be done Lets not forget Jeff Bridges and his great psychiatric Lastly a masterpiece that speakes for itself Can keep our eyes wide open from the beginning to the credits and our minds thinking even when the movie is over If you still didnt watch it go right now And again again,1
The Hindi version of the film is 121 minutes Set in Bengal in the early 1900s the film based on Tagores novel draws an analogy between the British colonization of India and the subjugation of women An educated and beautiful woman Binodini becomes a widow within a year of her marriage but she does not accept the constraints imposed on her as a widow by her society The film has a beautiful look to it but perhaps Aishwarya Rai is out of her depth in portraying Binodinis strong character with its subtle combination of idealism and deviousness Binodinis idealism does not come across and as a result the analogy between women and colonization remains somewhat buried,1
This film makes American Pie a sophisticated movie No further comment needed Humor is cheap dialogues are stupid and the cast is awkward Every clich is used several times without any original twist And far the worst the movie turns out to be more catholic than the Pope Its so sad,0
This film is riveting but in much the same way a car crash is riveting Its hard to look away Overall this film is nothing more than an incredibly irresponsible social experimentand a futile biased experiment at that The filmmakers are manipulative and seem to have no problems going for the lowest possible denominator The manner in which the money is presented to Ted is pure exploitation The intervening steps that the filmmakers force Ted to participate in meeting with socalled experts were empty and devoid of any substantive attempt to connect with Ted Instead its painfully obvious that they serve to cover the filmmakers posteriors and to further exploit Teds situation The worst part is that the filmmakers stop following Ted after 6 months and seemingly are cut off entirely from the subject they had followed so closely months before If they had cared they would have found better experts to help Ted If they truly wanted to see what Ted would do then they should have let him spend the money without any intervention This film is at best a highbrow Jackass stunt and not a documentary Its sad to think how much 100000 could have actually changed a homeless persons life had it been put in the right hands,0
Oh where to begin The cinematography was great When the movie first started because of the initial landscape scenes I thought that I was in for a good movie Then the cgi Bigfoot showed up It looked like a cartoon drawing of the Lion king and king Kongs love childIt totally took away from the believability of the characterNow I knew there wasnt a Bigfoot chasing people hiking around the woods for no apparent reason but a cheesy cgi cartoonSo from then on the whole movie was shot for meThe money they flushed down the toilet for the cgi they could of spent on a costume like roger Patterson did His was the best Bigfoot costume ever no one else could match hisI am a hardcore cheesy Bigfoot movie fan and I was warned about this movie but my compulsion led me to watching this movie and I was disappointed like the previous reviews warned me about I know after you read this review you will still say I must watch Sasquatch huntersmust watch Sasquatch hunters Then you will say why did I waste my good hard earned money on such a excruciatingly bad boring movie,0
12 Out of While I am not concerned with the fact that this is an English dubbed version as some reviewers have mentioned it should be noted as it seems to reside in many Quebecois native hearts However this was a movie as a child that I was a fervent admirer of keeping in mind now that it was made for children I rate it on a relative basis The story is of children on winter break building an awesome snow fort and jostling backnforth for control with weapons such as snowballs and other concoctions as idle hands and free time equal winter break lessons If I had children this definitely is a film I would try and get them interested in as the snow fort wowed me when I was young and I think even children today would agree albeit with Pixar and all the computer animation maybe I am out of date and just dont realize it In addition the movies message is wonderfully allegorical and a positive one at that for children and adults alike,1
I will give it this it tried It did try to make it good and even got Luke Wilson involved Luke Wilson is good but he can only do so much He cant make up for the fact that the story was very flawed and the characters were underdevelopedThe running gag with the bully was asinine He was never funny and I got tired of the gag really fast And the barefooted kid bit was kind of weak too He hitchhiked to Florida Yeah OKThe movie felt like an average kiddie film at times with this underlining mantra adults stupid kids smart And that bit gets tiresomeBut the only moments that were funny was the police cart Wilson drove around when he lost his squad car I loved that little cart especially when Wilson turned on the sirens But other than that nothing else was worth my time D,0
Less Than Zero could have been the 80s movie that reveals teenage apathy in its most extreme form had they actually stuck to the damn book But where they hadnt this movie presents does the job and leaves you with the creepiest feeling when its all over in ways not done until the late nineties with Larry Clarks movies Kids and Bully Societal outcast teens are faced with a rather curious dilemma they dont treat it much like one when their estranged friend Daniel Roebuck boasts to them that he killed a teenage girl near the rivers edge in their suburban town Keanu Reeves may be the only civilized character among the bunch the only one willing to exhibit any sort of conscience anyway while the others either dont do anything about the girls death or want to help their friend hide the body I dont know who is more sick in this filmCrispin Gloverwho becomes nearly obsessed and quite paternal in trying to protect the friend and hide the crime by smuggling him out of the state Dennis Hopper an onedge drug dealer who clings to a female blowup doll that befriends the teens as a dealer of course and suddenly becomes involved in the events Or Josh Miller who plays Reeves little brother Tim He appears to be the most apathetic of them all at least until his emotional breakdown at the end It is definitely not peppy 80s teen fare obviously And certainly makes the point strikingly clear about the serious detachment these kids deal with despite a bizarre series of events thanks to many great performances all around even Reeves proved some acting capabilityHelp yourself to a comedy to recover if it rocks you too hard,1
I just discovered this obscure 70s horror movie while browsing on YouTube For a lowbudget effort it has plenty of compelling moments in gradual pacing in leading to the surprisingly shocking finish While there is one woman who takes off her shirt constantly the fact that shes a nymphomaniac makes those scenes important to the story and theres one scene with the curlyhaired young man as he attempts to seduce her that turned me on before his pulling back made her screaming mad The young nurse who comes in and gets hired is alluring herself and Im not surprised she posed for the cover of Playboy Some characters are very irritating and some scenes do seem ridiculous For the most part however Dont Look in the Basement Thats the title I saw on YouTube provides enough drama and chills for an entertaining Bmovie,1
Wow the plot for this film is all over the place There is so much plot and so many things that happen that it practically made my head spin And as a result none of it seemed particularly believableThe movie starts with Kay Francis as a housewife living in a small town Shes had some experience with local theater and has ambitions of going to Broadway When a bigtime actor arrives in town she pursues him in hopes that he can give her a career boost But her husband is worried about shenanigansas this actor is a cad So the hubby bursts in on them and hits the actorand the actor dies As a result hes convicted of First Degree Murder Not Manslaughter but Murder 1 Now pregnant and in need of funds Kay goes to New York But Broadway jobs arent to be found so shes forced to take any jobeven Burlesque Unable to adequately care for her young daughter she gives it to another woman to raise However eventually she does find a job in a real Broadway play and everything looks rosy But the jealous diva starring in the play hates her for some inexplicable reason and forces her to be thrown off the play Despondent she makes her way to England and becomes a real star Years later she returns to New York to get her kidbut the child is older and thinks the woman caring for her is her real mother At the same time her husbands lawyer now thinks that if he gets 10000 he can get the man out of prison As another reviewer wrote is this to bribe people How can 10000 get him out otherwisemaybe it will buy a helicopter so they can fly into the prison yard and scoop him up Wowthis is enough for 2 or 3 films And all this occurs by the 45 minute mark Believe it or not theres quite a bit more to it If you really care see it yourself to find out how it all unfoldsThis is sort of like kitchen sink writingthrowing in practically everything and hoping somehow it will all work Unfortunately the film turns out to be hopelessly unbelievable and mushy despite Ms Francis best efforts Its the sort of film no one could really have saved thanks to a 2ndrate plot Its almost as if someone just took a few dozen plot elements threw them into a box and then began randomly picking them in order to make a movie Overall unless you are a diehard Kay Francis fan or love anything Hollywood made in the 1930s this one is one you can easily skip Not terrible but certainly not goodBy the way the child who plays Francis daughter upon her return to New York Sybil Jason really was terrible I think she was supposed to beI think,0
This movie obviously had good intentions At the end there is a dedication to someone named Kellie who as a viewer I can only assume found herself in a situation similar to the one the movie depicts Perhaps she made the wrong choice That dedication is the ONLY redeeming quality of Love SuicideThe movie becomes unbearable from the opening sequence Once the viewer is already that irritated only about five minutes into the film its pretty much going to be downhill after thatwhich it was I know the film was low budget and the camera shots were actually pretty goodunfortunately everything else was horrid The acting the plot the sound quality the picture qualitythe acting Im sorry but the acting is horrible Beyond horrible Its as if the actors are trying to act like people acting Thats the only way I can think to describe it As I watched I actually pictured the script with the stage direction in my mind None of the movements were natural and none of the characters reactions to one another fit In short the timing is WAY off The timing of the entire film is way off Im no director so I know the limits of my knowledge but I really feel there had to be SOME way to convey the passing of timeuntil they explained about graduation not being too far away I was under the impression that the first portion of the movie had taken place over the span of a weeka month at mostAll that being said its really a shame This movie truly could have been powerful with a little tweaking All the moments in the film in which we are supposed to feel something are obvious but only because the setup is obvious which is a bad thing The moving scenes totally fell flat For instance when Kayes brother takes his hat of his head and puts it on hers we should feel the understanding he has for her the innocence and protectiveness of the love of her brothersomehow it just doesnt come off that way There are so many more scenes like this for example ALL of the fight scenes and all they do is take away from the movie All these things put together Love Suicide comes off as one long cheesy lowbudget commercial,0
I first saw this movie in a queer film festival 10 minutes after the movie ended a gay couple walked up to me and asked me whether I needed help I was still sitting crying like a maniac The movie is cheesy its bizarre its over the top its gay but it is amazing I do think that every character is plausible Everetts character is mean to a woman who only tries to help he brutally throws his terrible friends out he does have a temper he can harm a fly the fly that killed the love of his life doubly so Bates is a miracle she is perfect just like a role A woman whose love and admiration is so strong that she even loves the homosexual lover of her idol is to me the essence of true love I even understand Max the husband he is bored with his life hes got a midlife crisis He moves out tries to lead an exciting life only to realise a that hes the really boring part in the relationship and b that he loves his wife I love the fact that she comes back to him in the end because I think that it gives the film the right balance between dream and reality For in the end hes her husband and he might not be as exciting as Victor but hes real he is the man she loves in a very down to earth way Ive watched it about 50 times and I do love this film everything about it unconditionally BTW just read Rupert Everetts autobiography and UL is the only film that he talks of as one of the best films he ever made To me its the best film he ever made,1
I have read the 28 most recent comments by various people regarding this movie and was surprised that no one mentioned the fact that the first victim shown on the bed with the missing eyelids as the camera pans up and away from her face blinks Yes BLINKS I recorded it as it came on HBO this past weekend and when I saw this I literally had to replay it several times focusing on one eye at a time to make sure that I was not seeing things Of course after that it was hard to take the movie seriously although there were a few interesting and intense scenes with Julian Sands Very disappointed and give it a 4 mostly due to the fact that the 1st victim blinks in one of the last frames as the camera pulls away from the bodyface Too bad,0
First things first the female lead is too gorgeous to be missed Now actress Wang Zu Xian the one who played Xiao Qian in the movie is 42 years old and well aged Its always good to review these glorious times when seeing oldschool HongKong productions like thisThe movie is one of the most influential titles made in 1980s The art set decoration and other aesthetic facets are all mesmerizing More fantastically the movie had a total black humorous undertone in it It feels like a horror movie but ultimately its not scaring but only funI had the experience of translating the second script of A Chinese Ghotst Story and I thought that script was a decent write However when I saw the movie I firstly was disappointed in seeing the movie different from the script like in a smaller scale and involving more comic roles However it turned out to be better executed in terms of being entertainingIf you have seen the Lord of the Rings you will notice the similarities in this movie to LOTR The climax is like a mirror of Miranda Otto fighting with the Ring Witch Its definitely a laughoutloud Bravo,1
as a habit i always like to read through the hated it reviews of any given movie especially one that id want to comment on and its not so much a pointcounterpoint sorta deal i just like to see what people say on the flipsidehowever i do want to address one thing many people that hated it called it to paraphrase beautiful but shallow some even going so far as to say that norms desire yet inability to help his brother was a mundane plot at bestid like to disagreeas a brother of a sibling who has a similar dysfunction i can relate daily you see them abuse themselves knowing only that their current path will inevitably lead them to selfdestruction and its not about the specifics of what they did when how or why paul decided to take up gambling and associating with questionable folks its really more how they are wired on one hand they are veritable geniuses and on the other painfully selfdestructive its a lot like people like howard hughes the same forces which drive them are the same forces which tear them apart and all the while you see this you know this and whats worse you realize you cant do a damn thing about itfor norman maclean a river runs through it was probably a way to find an answer to why the tragedy had to occur and who was to blame in the end no one is and often there is no why but it takes a great deal of personal anguish to truly come to this realization sometimes it takes a lifetime and sometimes it never comes at all,1
This is a new approach to comedy It isnt funnyThe joke is that this in and of itself is supposed to be funnyThe story is based on a French short story located in Paris and the characters have French names Louis Aubinard for example played by Bob Hoskins The movie also stars the equally French Jeff Goldblum and Natasha Richardson The situations are similar to and the characters perform as if in those CarryOn movies from years backI believe these are also jokes to cast these actors who make no attempt to act French in any way to have them cavort in the manner of broad English dance hall comedy and to leave the whole bloomin mystery unexplained to the audienceIn the humour department this is practically the Algonquin Round Table isnt itThe movie tries to be charming and quirky and I guess these characteristics are sort of funny Not as funny as Duck Soup or Love and Death perhaps but funnier than The Deer Hunter or The Battleship PotemkinIt is an example of personal filmmaking It makes no real effort to reach out and share with the audience but stays true to its premise and its internal logic Although all the situations are unbelievable they are logical within the films own bizarro worldI generally like this kind of eccentric movie but I found this one to be paced too slowly to be dullwitted tedious and to provide too few pleasurable surprises or genuine wit It just kind of meanders in predictable and sophomoric ways and wastes some wonderful talents along the way It has to be the low point in the career of each of the major stars who are all otherwise distinguished players I found it to be the biggest waste of talent since The Betsy and I wish I had never seen Goldblum and Hoskins in this thingSo call it an interesting miss and pass on it as a rental unless you really have a lot of time to kill,0
When I saw that this film was being aired on late night TV I initially decided to give it a miss I am glad that I then started watching Yes the special effects are the same as Gerry Andersens puppet shows Some of the actorsactresses are from his other productions he obviously used the same composer later on as the cheesy soundtrack could only have come from one of his productions and the plot is as slow as a wet weekend Get by all that and you have a film that shows up intriguing possibilities Is there a planet on the far side of the sun Is it a duplicate earth Is everything about it reversed and if so do they speak English in reverse I love this dated SF if only for Gerrys wonderful model cars planes buildings and spaceships Some of them are not so far fetched as they seemed back then And did you see the European Space Centre logo Very reminiscent of the Euro logo of today Suspend belief and spend a couple of hours watching this you will be glad you did,1
After the opening credits over a black sheet of paper with spots of white paint sprayed onto it oh OK Ill be generous and call it a star field we witness an alien spacecraft crashing into a meteorite and being forced to land on earth A terrible looking model spacecraft lands on a terrible looking model field Three nearby campers investigate From the burning spacecraft a reptile like looking alien the Nightbeast emerges OK so I lied its a guy in a dodgy rubber monster mask and silver spacesuit The campers are quickly killed by the Nighbeasts laser gun which shoots awful special effects at people The towns Sheriff Jack Cinder Tom Griffith is informed He alerts his deputy Lisa Kent Karin Kardian and gathers a posse of men together to investigate Meanwhile the Nightbeast has killed an unlucky motorist who stopped on the side of the road for a leak His two annoying kids run for help They approach a house inside two young people are kissing the girl says someones running towards the house The guy gets up to take a look and is attacked and gutted by the Nightbeast it kills the girl as well Then it manages to kill the two kids with his laser maybe the Nightbeast aint so bad after all Once the Sheriff and his men arrive at the scene they have a gunlaser battle with the Nightbeast After possibly the most unexciting gun fight in film history only the Sheriff his deputy and a local man Jamie Lambert Jamie Zemarel survive But the Nightbeast is still alive bullets seem to have no effect on it The next day the Sheriff visits the towns Mayor Bert Wicker Richard Dyszel and his girlfriend Mary Jane Eleanor Herman to get permission to evacuate everyone in the town He refuses saying a party he is holding for the Governor Richard Ruxton cannot be cancelled and that he doesnt want to create a panic situation The Sheriff evacuates the town anyway Two doctors Steven Price George Stover and Ruth Sherman Anne Firth are attacked by the Nightbeast before they can leave However they manage to scare the Nightbeast away and survive Together with the Sheriff his deputy and Jamie they decide to stay behind and fight the alien Written and directed by Don Dohler this has to be an amateur film made with family and friends look at the credits and see how many Dohlers are involved For that reason I should probably cut it some slack but that still doesnt stop it or excuse it from being a throughly awful film in every department It has no story or purpose things just happen to waste time whats with Drago Don Leifert strangling his ex girlfriend Suzie Monica Neff This and many more scenes add nothing to the film The script has no logic either why does the Nightbeast stick around the town once its been supposedly evacuated The special effects are embarrassingly bad just look at the effect when the Nightbeast shoots someone with his laser a computer effect an 80s spectrum would be ashamed of Theres not really much blood or gore in it a ripped open stomach a severed arm and a decapitation but they all look predictably poor Credit where its due the Nightbeast itself looks alright for the most part Theres a sex scene between the Sheriff and his deputy which has to be seen to be believed music that even a porno would be embarrassed about and two really ugly naked people make this a difficult sequence to watch Less than stellar acting photography music lighting and editing make it a real chore to sit through And the worse thing about this film It commits the mortal sin of being boring and not fun in the slightest Sorry Don mate but dont give up the day job Definitely one to avoid,0
As much as I love Ellen Barkin who is really underrated I have to boo this movie If you cant tell who did it AND why in the first half hour you obviously have never seen a psychosexual thriller or have never watched 2020 Its like the filmmakers and actors didnt care that they way they were shooting it and they way they were playing the characters would be a dead giveawayOverall this movie serves to turnon the dirty perverts who like to mix violence and sex Not a fun movie to sit through although if you like Ellen Barkin its nice to see her place a tough lady,0
The screen writers for this miniseries should have been sentenced to the guillotine themselves They butchered a very fun story and squandered the talents of Richard E Grant The only thing the writers kept from the original books was the name All of the characters were totally altered and the story was not the same I strongly suggest watching another version of the Scarlet Pimpernel Any other version is better than this one,0
In Arlington Heights IL we never had a cafeteria in any of the elementary schools 1961 so I rode my bike home from school for lunch and always watched this game True I was 11 but I thought it was the greatest thing on Id draw hidden pictures on my blackboard and see if my family or friends could find it I also remember winning wonderful cars Pontiac or Oldsmobile if the contestant got the final hidden picture game I even had the home versionI wonder why this game lasted so briefly I enjoyed the music and the hidden pictures the only one I could ever get was the lemon hidden as part of a bridge over a garden streamReally good memories are connected with Camouflage,1
Skip McCoy is a three time loser pick pocket unable to curb his instincts back on the street he picks the purse of Candy on a subway train What he doesnt realise is that Candy is carrying top secret microfilm microfilm that is of high interest to many many organisationsDirector Samuel Fuller has crafted an exceptional drama set amongst the seedy underworld of New York City Communist spies and shady government operatives all blend together to make Pickup On South Street a riveting viewing from first minute to the last Based around a Dwight Taylor story called Blaze Of Glory Fuller enthused this adaptation with heavy set political agenda something that many at the time felt was over done but to only focus on its anti communist leanings is doing it a big disserviceDigging a little deeper and you find characters as intriguing as any that Fuller has directed the main protagonist for one is the hero of the piece a crook and a shallow human being his heroics are not born out of love for his country they are born out of his sheer stubborn streak Its quite an achievement that Fuller has crafted one of the best anti heroes of the 50s and im sure he was most grateful to the performance of Richard Widmark as McCoy all grin and icy cold heart his interplay with the wonderful Jean Peters as Candy is excellent and is the films heart However it is the Oscar nominated Thelma Ritter who takes the acting honours her Moe is strong and as seedy as the surrounding characters but there is a tired warmth to her that Ritter conveys majesticallyIts a B movie in texture but an A film in execution Pickup On South Street is a real classy and entertaining film that is the best of its most intriguing director 910,1
This movie is a riot I cannot remember the last time I had such a great time at the movies Ive seen a few good comedies in my time and usually they are pretty funny But this one is wall to wall great lines I think Best in Show is the last movie that I laughed so hard and so much in The movie was nonstop until the end when they did the 5 minutes of sentimental plot clean up Other than that its a constant barrage of one liners and goofy situations Id like to see it again before it leaves the theater because this is like the Zucker movies where you dont get all the jokes the first time around You have to see it two or three times to get it all inAs far as the actual film goes it could have used a better edit its choppy at times but we have to be forgiving for that All the characters are great Its not like an Adam Sandler movie where he tries to be funny and everyone else suffers around him and is the butt of the joke I think I will remember all the main characters for years to come because they are all so likable No victims in this movie Also thank God they got a 45 year old actress to play his girlfriend Catherine Keener plays her and she is a sweetheart in this film You just wish that women like her really existed Shes not a 10 like some of the other leading ladies but somehow her smile is warmer than Julia Roberts overdone overbiteIf you see the trailer for this film you may not think too highly of it I assure you the trailer does not do it justice They do not give away all the good jokes Just some of the mediocre onesOh and one more thing I hope critics put this on their top ten list Many of them complain that comedies dont get the recognition they deserve and then at the end of the year they dont put it on their list This means you Ebert,1
I gave it a 10 since everyone else seemed to like it and it would have been churlish not to The reason Im troubling you is to add a personal observation on Castles workIve seen Homicidal and The Tingler the version with the clever colour sequence where everything except the blood is in black and white a few times and The House On Haunted Hill many timesEven I am not old enough to have seen them when Castle was up to his showman tricks thus I can appreciate them for their own merit And while most pass him off as secondrate schlocky hammy etc I believe they do him a disserviceThe end sequence of Homicidal is GENUINELY shocking and works today and the premise of The Tingler while silly was highly originalBut The House On Haunted Hill was a TRIUMPH Having used that Frank Lloyd Wright house as its exterior the great Vincent Price and a solid cast plus a good score and production values when I first saw it at a packed latenight showing in the late Sixties it produced an audience reaction Id not seen before and have not seen sinceIt was the bit where the heroine is alone in the basement if youve not seen the film stop reading NOW and we are waiting to hear the hero on the other side of the wallWith NO telegraphing of what is coming the camera slowly pulls back forcing the AUDIENCE to switch their gaze to Im saying no more my spoiler declaration above only covers THIS movieThe point is I believe this ploy was DELIBERATE not accidental and when it happened the WHOLE AUDIENCE SCREAMED including most of the men It took the audience about TEN MINUTES to calm downNow THAT is superior filmmaking A flamboyant showman he might have been but House and the other two films Ive mentioned were GOOD MOVIES Castle may not have been a Hitchcock but he was no Ed Wood eitherIts easy to concentrate on someones quirks and forget to examine their TALENT So I hope this documentary acknowledged that I look forward to seeing it,1
Made in 1931 this foreign film should be seen and enjoyed more oftenWe open on a quiet little French village scanning the roofs of the sleeping citizens Then we hear something that sounds like a party Upon investigating the uproar two neighboring men are told the story of two men supposedly friends who picked two numbers for the lotteryOur star of the picture has his number and his friend his When he asks his friend would he share half of the dough should his ticket be the winning number his friend promptly says no In fact HE double hockey sticks no is the way he acts about itSo when our man discovers he has the winning ticket and that it has been lost through no fault of his own he is frantic Everyone is out for themselves looking for this ticket in something like a precursor to The Great Race Even though this is all a flashback I was in knots the whole time and got so upset over every little thing in this allforme showmethemoney cashinthebank film Watch Le Million today,1
Fay Grim is a true example of what I call a completed puzzle film It has all the pieces of acting direction storyline and entertainment value They all fit together and when done so create a masterpiece Fay GrimThis film follows a single mother Fay Grim trying to raise her son to not grow up to be her father who ran away from the law and went missing Soon the CIA contacts Fay in desperate pursuit to find 8 journals of her husband Henrys These journals were filled with confessions of his long past in the CIA and his involvement with countries and their government doings Fay is sent to find these journals in return to release her brother from prison and is sent on a catandmouse chase all over Europe to recover these journals and learn of the hidden secrets of her husbands past she never knew aboutParker Posey had already been an actress I liked after I watched her in The OH in Ohio and Best in Show She brought liveliness to these two comedic roles of hers but Fay Grim was a far different role than the other two movies Posey made me believe what was happening on screen I felt for her I rooted for her and I wanted to know more She grabs you while she is on screen and when she is off you cant stop thinking about what is happening to herI havent seen any other previous works by writerdirector Hal Hartley but I believe I will look into viewing some of his earlier films if they are half as good as Fay Grim wasIf you decide to make a smart movie choice next time you decide to rent a movie or purchase a DVD Id highly urge you to choose Fay Grim If you have any common sense on how a film should be you will enjoy this movie immensely,1
Based on a selfserving novel by onetime girl friend and groupie of F Scott Fitzgerald gossip columnist Sheila Graham wrote this trashy story Gregory Peck carries on in shameless excess as a forceful bedrunkorbedamned alcoholic in contradiction to the gentle and soft spoken real Scott Fitzgerald Focusing on Fitzgeralds Hollywood writing era late in his life the muchhonored author was in fact living a quiet life and effectively fighting his alcoholism at a time when AA was not yet well known Fitzgerald was nonetooproud to be recycling his flapper stories in order to support both his wife in a mental hospital and his daughter in college Living in a small apartment and driving a second hand Chevrolet his life was 180 degrees different than as portrayed in this movieVirtually every 20th CenturyFox movie made during Daryll F Zanucks leadership as well as virtually every film directed by Henry King was a work of excellence Beloved Infidel was the exception,0
No Ive never seen any of the Santa Slasher series ie Silent Night Deadly Night the original Black Christmas or this one Christmas Evil Ive heard all about their reputation or MADS Mothers Against Deranged Santas I thought I would rent this one as Ive heard it pop up as a reference on a Fat Guys At the Movies segmentMothers should be against this but not for the ooooohhhh killer Santa but for the fact this movie was just plain crap Boring long even at only 92 minutes crapLittle boy sees Santa arrive down a chimney in 1947 deliver presents eat some goodies and miraculously float up the chimney Boy goes to bed but returns to living room to witness Mommy and Santa sort of getting it on Apparently this messed up that kid for the rest of his life though the scene was about as steamy as when Ralphies dad got the Leg Lamp in A Christmas Story He was sooo disturbed he went to the attic and well cut his own handFast forward to the future Now its 1980 and messed up boy works in a toy factory We get a whiff of him being a little offkilter and he stalks both kids and parents alike Whos naughty whos nice blah blah It takes a good twothirds of the film to get him to finally snap as if thats not foreshadowed from frame one NO MOVIE should take that longI will admit this movie had its tension building but only because I kept expecting him to do something anything to anyone When he finally does well punish whos naughty its as graphic as a Garbage Pail Kid card And I havent mentioned the WTF ending Im thinking it was a metaphor but in reality its just as weird as the rest of the movie Take the brother whos upset his sibling is killing and his solution is uh killing Dont open this mess even on Christmas Eve or Evil Again I didnt watch the other SantaSlashers but this one sucked bad It built up suspense due to the nature of the movie and never once delivered a decent present,0
I recently got THE SEVENUPS on video and I must say it was a very enjoyable movie Roy Scheider and Tony Lo Bianco are great as the cop and crook respectively and a young Richard Lynch is great as psycho henchman Moon The late Bill Hickman is pretty good as his associate Bo and sets up a brilliant car chase sequence which will have you on the edge of your seats The other three members of the SevenUps team are pretty bland but thats only to be expectedIm glad that a lot of people on this site have supported this movie I think it should be a film that should be released on DVD and not just forgotten I certainly enjoyed every minute of it The final scene between the two leads is excellent as the bad guy must face the consequences of his actions THE SEVENUPS does not disappoint,1
Brides are dying at the altar and their corpses are vanishing No one knows why or who but an investigative reporter Luana Walters notes that each bride was wearing a strange orchid and she goes to interview its creator Dr Lorenz Bela Lugosi Now Dr Lorenz is a mad scientist with some strange habits including sleeping in coffins and injecting his elderly wife Elizabeth Russell with the fluid of young brides to keep her youngThe Corpse Vanishes has an interesting premise and a short enough run time that it shouldnt be able to get boring Unfortunately while it starts off quite well it does start to drag before the halfway point and gets rather boring with its clichs and predictable plotThere are some good things about itBela Lugosi is charming and evil and performs brilliantly Elizabeth Russell is also a beautiful suave aloof and very creepy countess and Im always a fan of Angelo Rossitto Luana Walters is also convincing as the reporter hereIt maintains a bit of a Gothic atmosphere and the sets are decentBut overall it just didnt manage to hold my interest through the whole picture and for that I have to rate it poorly,0
No redeeming features this film is rubbish Its jokes dont begin to be funny The humour for children is pathetic and the attempts to appeal to adults just add a tacky smuttishness to the whole miserable package Sitting through it with my children just made me uncomfortable about what might be coming next I couldnt enjoy the film at all Although my child for whom the DVD was bought enjoyed the fact that she owned a new DVD neither she nor her sisters expressed much interest in seeing it again unlike with Monsters inc Finding Nemo Jungle Book Lion King etc which all get frequent requests for replays,0
This movie was supposedly based on a nonfiction book Im not sure what book the script writers read to write their adaptation but it has absolutely nothing to do with the true life adventures of Frances Mayes in Italy Instead it is an uninteresting tale that takes liberties at every juncture to bash men Note the following examplesSPOILER DETAILSBash Number One Lanes husband cheats on her and her marriage ends in a divorceBash Number Two Lane ventures into a local Italian town and is promptly solicited by every male on the streetBash Number Three Lane is saved from the horny town folk men by a charming gentlemen She falls for him after consummating an afternoon of love making She later finds out that hes already attached and cheating with herBash Number Four You have to broaden your horizon for this one because the reference is definitely is in the movie Her lesbian couple friends decide to have a baby by invetro SP fertilization I am told that in most lesbian relationships you have one person assuming the female role and another assuming the male role In the movie after the female has been made pregnant the male lesbian decides to run out on the relationship because she can not handle itIn conclusion this movie has nothing to do with the book that it was supposedly based on,0
I turn on 700 Club once in awhile and only agree with some of the statements made Im one of many believers that is considered liberal by most Christians and conservative by most nonChristians I vote my mind and its usually not rep or dem i dont believe 700 club tells people what to believe but that it represents many older christians that grew up in very conservative backgrounds i think many folks misunderstand what is said on 700 club it bums me out to hear name calling either direction i think 700 club folks really do love Jesus but are so busy trying to get people to vote conservatively that theyve forgotten to show love to certain people and promote peace like Jesus did Please dont judge Jesus based on ignorant individuals that believe on Him and lets also not be as ignorant with our comments about them Why ARE people so mean to each other,0
Bizarre take on the Cinderella tale Terribly poor script but Kathleen Turner turns in a pretty decent evil stepmother performanceVisually stunning in some parts but thats about it The period costumes range from the Elizabethan era to the 1990s Fast forward until you see something interesting and save yourself the full 90 minutes of drivelIf youre really in the mood for a Cinderella story I suggest Ever After A Cinderella Story or The Glass Slipper,0
This is definatley one of the best standup shows evre EVER Eddie is so off the wall that Ive been watching this damn show for nearly five years now and it still rocks every single time Just everything from his big broad physical comedy down to the little off the top of the head side remarks its a masterpeice You need look no further than this line The word herb You say erb and we say herb cuz thers a fing h in it Brilliant,1
Okay I rented this movie because of the directorhe has made some interesting flicks in the past if you havent seen Waxork you are missing a fun ride Anyway I had my doubts about this movie from the beginning but I decided to suck it up and give it a look Its bad Very bad If you havent seen the movie and dont mind spoilers read ahead First of all the old saying You cant judge a book by its cover applies here The box for this flick seems to indicate that Jill is the stone fox with long hair with highlights The back of the box has a cool shot of the redleather Jill and some other shots The description makes you want to rent the movie because it SOUNDS good You start watching it and suddenly you find out that the movie takes place inexplicably in 1977 Jill is a total dog who is not the girl on the cover The movie is not quite as predictable as you would thinkand thats not a good thing Characters do so many stupid things without any modicum of motivationits embarrassing to watch 10 minutes before the end of the movie Dolph and another lady have sex for no good reason Also what was the point of having Dolph kill this other lady in cold blood who had been helping him Anthony Hickox the director should have seen a stinker when he read the script Had it been set in the underworld of the new milennium and made the characters halfway intelligent it might have been decent To set it in the 70s makes no sense and has no bearing on the story whatsoever Avoid it,0
Some Spoilers Dull as dishwater slasher flick that has this deranged homeless man Harry Darwyn Swalve out murdering realestate agent all over the city of LA because of the high prices that they charge for their proprieties Looking like an extra from a Clint Eastwood Spaghetti Western Harry whos been living in abandoned houses eating dog food gets very upset where his quite lifestyle as a squatter is interrupted This happens when a number of realestate agents invaded his space in an attempt to sell the houses that hes staying at to their potential clientsJoseph Bottome stars in this bottomofthebarrel horror movie as radio talkshow host Dr David Kelly the handsome and popular host psychologist of the KDRX survival line DR Kelly is being sued by the family of one of his callersTracy who ended up blowing her brains out while on the air with the doc who couldnt do anything to help her survive her ordeal of taking to himThe realestate killer gets to talk with Dr Kelly on the air about his adventures and the police try to get the doc to get his phone number and address by keeping him on the line but he refuses to in order not to hurt his rating by having potential callers not call in in fear of being monitored by the LADP Kelly also is having a hot and heavy affair with a realestate manager and agent the busty Lisa Grant Adrienne Barbeau whos office of sellers are Harrys main victims in he movie Harry also gets to murder Lisas main competition in the housing business the chubby and outrageous Barney Resnick Barry Hope who threatened to put Lisa out of business by any means possible even if he has to kill her Getting Berney alone and with his pants down Harry slices his head off while hes being entertained by one of his clients a hooker whom he leaves dead and hanging together with the headless Barney The movie ends with the deranged Harry taking Lisa hostage and having Dr Kelly try to come to her rescue only to have Det Shapiro Robert Miano looking like e hasnt slept in a week pop out of nowhere and blow Harrys brains out Harry quickly come back to life minus the gay matter between his ears and gets himself killed for the second time in the movie by being thrown from a balcony and landing on the ground as a dozen members of the LAPD M16 cocked and ready come on the sceneNothing in the movie Opean House worked with the tension laughable to almost nonexistent Even the hot sex scenes between Dr Kelly and Lisa didnt save the movie since there were far too fewonly two of them and and sexy Adrienne Barbeau was a bit too underexposed with not enough light and too much clothes on in all of themHarry the killer in the movie was also a bit to comical to be taken seriously in trying to make a point to Dr Kelly on the phone and in person about the high rents and realestate prices in the country and how people like himself find it almost impossible to find a decent place to live in You can sympathize with Harrys concern about the high cost of living but be very critical of him in how he crazily went on in correcting it,0
This relic from before the days of the Production Code and the Hays Office is good fun not great but entertainingBased on a song by Rogers Hart that was an enormous hit at the time the story revolves around dance hall girl Barbara Stanwyck who is romanced by wealthy businessman Ricardo Cortez who was indecently handsome but whose heart belongs to her bookish neighbor Monroe Owsley She and Owsley marry but keep it a secret while she dismisses Cortez who still holds out hope She helps hubby get a job in Cortezs company but married bliss quickly turns sour as Owsley develops a taste for the high life and steps out with a college sweetheart and gambles in highstakes bridge Yup I know its pretty funny Finally he embezzles 5000 from Cortez and is about to go on the lam when his devoted wife goes to Cortezand I wont reveal anything else although the ending was certainly a surpriseStanwyck is the best thing about this movie in one of her earliest roles shes quite accomplished Owsley is the weak point hes unattractive and sniveling while Cortez is amazingly suave and sexy while his performance is earnest but unremarkableWhile ostensibly a drama its filled with laughs many inadvertant as some elements of this movie have aged very poorly But there are a lot of good witty lines at one point Stanwyck says to Cortez My brains are in my feet while yours are in Thats pretty darn suggestive for 1931 Theres a lot of bawdy and suggestive stuff in this flick in the last days before the Code clamped down and whitewashed everything An amusing antique a good reminder of how far we havent come in 70 yearsthis story could very easily be changed to fit 2003 but could keep the basic plot with the original ending in place,1
This is an interesting movie I think its very humorous although the humor is very black Fulci is good and funny acting himself its a really funny and truly crazy selfportrait of an artist I make horror films If I would make love films noone would buy tickets And its really SEXY movie also Almost all the time there is some action or tension going on and many sexy girlswomen Maybe it goes to the core of why anyone starts to do moviesart in the first place Its a real psychedelic trip maybe best seen a little drunk or some similar state of mind There is some really nasty gore scenes also of course because its Lucio Fulci As a matter of fact some of those scenes are quite disgusting Anyway its one of the three best and most complete Fulci films Ive seen the others are House By The Cemetery ZombiHavent seen The Beyond Actually the script is overally to my opinion quite ingenious You could see this movie as a portrait of an extreme neurotic or a person who suffers from obsessivecompulsive disorder fashionable words The character has a compulsive need to confess crimes or bad thoughts Especially crimes he hasnt even DONE And he questions himself all the time What if I HAVE done it What if I want to do it Have I done it Do I want to do it He overreacts and exaggerates his thoughts Im sure Fulci has been interested of psychology and maybe even read something of the area in his House By The Cemeterymovie for example there is a character named Freudstein This is maybe the most concentrated and straightly personal movie Fulci did I also like the simplicity of the photographypictures in this film Only thing that disturbs me a little bit is the sadism especially towards women I dont quite understand why Is it entertainment Is it art Is it horror Anyways and overall this is really interesting and well made movie definitely recommended classic film at least for fans or anyone interested of this genre For the others it may be too much,1
Wow I picked this off the rental shelf because I loved Robert Carlyle and Jonny Lee Miller in Trainspotting This is a phenomenal movie it has action romance suspense intrigue and wit When I wasnt laughing I was at the edge of my seat This is definitely a film I would recommend to people with an appreciation for intelligent dialogue and a fresh perspective of the 18th century This film has everything to keep ME happy,1

This is amazinglooking movie with the whole thing done in just six or seven colors When it came out over 15 years ago it stunned audiences with its color scheme being so different from anything else that had ever been put on film Those colors for me at least make this an absolutely fascinating film to watch There are literally thousands of scenes I wish could freeze and somehow convert them to a painting to study for their artworkThe characters and the story dont match up to the greatness of the photography but they are all overthetop especially the villains The famous actors who played them here must have a had a lot of fun on the set playing Flatop Pruneface Lips Mumbles etcMeanwhile Warren Beatty and Gleanne Hedley are good as Dick Tracey and girlfriend Tess Truehart and shes as sweet and soft as her name Another good addition is Charlie Korsmo as the delinquent young boy Dick and Tess take under their wing The colorful other characters are played by Al Pacino Dustin Hoffman William Forysthe Paul Sorvino Mandy Patinkin Madona and other names you know but are too numerous to list here Check the full credits on the main page and youll amazedThe only negatives I found were Pacinos voice which grates on you after awhile Madonnas offkey singing voice and the fact that the film would have been better trimmed about 10 minutes Those faults are all minor because overall this is a fun moviea cartoon strip coming to life in an incrediblycolorful fashionlike nothing you have ever seen,1
where would one start a review of the film Snitchd James Cahill god rest his soul made one of the most daring insights into the human psyche since Encino Man his beautiful story unravels around a drug squad cop McClure which is a name synonymous with a character from the simpsons who also happens to be an actor said cop delves deep into the underworld that is high school drug taking and discovers a gang war to rival that of Police Academy 1 and i mean the one where Jones is racially vilified by his new partner but manages to come out with some of the funniest sounds you will EVER HEARCahills grasp of effects both visual and aural is electrifying the slight pause between action on screen and from the speakers adds to the drama that is snitchd a real gritty like underground thriller also kudos to his brilliant use of makeup such as the supremely convincing burn marks a gang member suffers in his showdown with an indoor barbecue YUCK i feel the world of film is much less from James passing his memory will linger on and on and on reborn with every passing mention of his flagship production Snitchd his insightful directors commentary released a cokehit up the nose of any discerning film goer truly appropriate with the harsh reality that is life on the streets captured in all the beauty of a roughneck punk knocking over a rubbish bin in a brawlbut i ask you why did the big bosses swimming pool look so cheap ill tell you why because thats life in Santa Ana baby its not all drive bys and hastily constructed principles offices oh no there are some folk who must infiltrate the soft tattooed underbelly of street life in LA to kick their way through in moves that would not seem out of place at a School For Special Childrens production of Double Dragon The Playthe only qualm i have with this film is that there was never a sequel made come on Steven Spielberg come on George Lucas come on guy that made revenge of the nerds 1 through 23 how hard could it be to step it up a notch and pay tribute to this great man James Cahillhe discovered Eva Longoria you know oh yeah that he didJonah,1
Video Vault By Shawn K InlowMy Architect A Sons Journey 2003 Nathaniel Kahn Not Rated 116minutes Vault Rating 7What a thing to be fatherless My Architect A Sons Journey follows Philadelphia filmmaker Nathaniel Kahn as he desperately seeks answers from his father the renowned architect Louis I Kahn dead these 30 yearsLouis Kahn died in a train station in 1974 and left behind more than one family The funeral service when the filmmaker was just a boy was shall we say an unpleasant surpriseWe find that Nathaniel only knew his father en passant from his sporadic visits with his mother whom we are told he loved deeply This movie is about a boy seeking his father and perhaps himself by visiting his work as if the magnificent structures hold some secret To be sure Louis Kahn was a gifted architect but architect is a cold word The man was a sculptor on a grand scale who spoke of his craft in airy terms of silence and artAmong his notable works explored lovingly in the film are the Salk Institute 1965 The Kimball Art Museum 1972 and the monumental capitol complex in Bangladesh 1983 The portion of the film where Nathaniel first visits Dhaka Bangladesh finds the work but not the manThe film benefits greatly from having much footage of the very public man as he worked in New York City and as a professor at Yale and the University of Pennsylvania Many of Khans contemporaries and collaborators also help flesh out the filmmakers ghost fatherEven so the viewer seems not to come to a particularly satisfying place The answers Nathaniel Khan is looking for seem hollow Not good enoughIn scenes where the director meets with his half sisters both from different mothers one can feel the tensions of the years the slights and hurts One might expect them to burst into anger but only the camera saves them from hostilities Each of these children has visibly lost somethingIt might be pointed out that Khan who seemed a driven perfectionist never became rich Instead he became noteworthy It was as if he sacrificed his family for his art This is a crushingly sad and great thingApril 28 2005,1
When one watches romantic comedies one knows what to expect weve seen enough of them over many many years to know how they go Theres a formula one which almost always begets movies that become popular with the genres audience not always in relation to their actual quality How to play around with that and create something more interesting This movie has a suggestion and it works relatively well Instead of simply following a lead we follow him skillfully helping the unfortunate men those who lack the attractive facade that would allow them to reveal the unseen good qualities that they possess to the women they are in love with The plot follows Smith as he works on his selfproclaimed most difficult such case Kevin James Alongside his aid of James we also follow Mendes who is fed up with men who lie to get what they wantone particular scene that inspires great respect of Smiths character is him meeting one such jerk and putting him in his place After seeing Smith helping the disaster that is James we see him with Mendes and in spite of his talent for helping others he messes up badly with her Making a marvelous point about love and how falling in love affects us For a romantic comedy this mostly avoids the pitfalls of suchat times almost bordering on feeling like a spoof of the genre though the last few scenes has the sweetness and the emotions of this type of films Whether or not they follow the formula will not be revealed in this review The pace is quite good it never really slows down and seldom moves too fast The acting is great as far as pretty much everyone goes The characters are nicely developed and come off as real people The humor doesnt always work there are occasional gags that are less than fortunately executed and one or two jokes that seem forced However for the most part the film was funny I recommend this to anyone who likes romantic comedies and anyone who is or have been in love Those who do not believe in love will have a difficult time with the last few scenes 710,1
I didnt really know what to expect from FutureKill but I certainly hoped it would be a little better than what I got I knew the rating was bad and the reviews were unfavorable but the Subversive DVDcover illustration looks beyond cool and I cant resist that For a very long too long in fact time this film raised the impression of being an unofficial sequel to Porkys with lame vulgar and offensive fraternity pranks Five megadorks one of them resembling an exact young clone of Jim Carrey desperately want to become members of a frat house but their ultimate initiation might just be a tad bit farfetched and dangerous They are dropped in the city center with provocative marks painted on their faces simultaneously with the outbreak of a violent gang war It doesnt take too long before they are confronted with Splatter a seemingly halfman and halfmachine warrior who leads a gang of which I never really figured out who or what they were Were they a government experiment Cyborgs Terminator imitations from a distant future Does anyone care FutureKill is a bizarre amateur flick with a scenario that leaps from one subject onto the other without any form of logical connection or narrative The plot borrows vital elements from great cinematic cult classics like The Warriors Escape from New York and The Terminator but the end result is one gigantic SciFi monstrosity The costumes and special effects are quite pitiable and theres a truckload of cheap and gratuitous nudity The acting is terrible but Im willing to blame the retarded dialogs instead of the cast members One to avoid at all costs in spite of really cool DVDcover art Resist it,0
There are so many things wrong with this movie that it is hard to pick just a few Lets start with the silly and annoying songs Like Ride Little Cowboy which just tended to accentuate the cityslickers look of Klinton Spilsbury The silly kiddie cowboy songs going on in the background during the movie hurt any credibility or momentum that the story had going for itI had seen the media hype before this movie was released and I saw Klinton Spilsbury interviewed on various TV shows and he had a very soft sweet lilting voice His body language was not exactly what people remembered who were fans of Clayton Moore and the Lone Ranger TV series Spilsbury did not help things by acting like a diva and talking trash about Clayton Moore after the Producers got an injunction prohibiting Moore from appearing at Conventions and other events as the original Lone Ranger Clayton Moore was not even allowed to sign as Clayton Moore The Lone Ranger He could only sign as The Masked Man The incredible amount of negative publicity that this move gave the film was only added to by the petulant attitude of Spilsbury who was very quick to tell reporters that Clayton Moore would be quickly forgotten once the movie came out Sadly even after the movie was a total flop the company that owned The Lone Ranger refused to lift their Injunction against Clayton Moore and he was never again permitted to sign anything except as The Masked Man and he could not don his black mask at any public appearances Between Spilsburys diva personality and the negative publicity the movie got it certainly did not help to make a good impression on the public Worse yet a few weeks before the movie was finally released the news was leaked that Spilsburys voice in the movie had been overdubbed by James Keech because the Producers thought that Spilsbury did not sound very convincing as a cowboy The ridicule and derision that this news brought on the talk shows and comedy shows of that era put the last nail into the coffinBut then there was Merle Haggard narrating his way through the movie Apparently the Producers were hoping that the macho image of Haggard one of the Outlaws of Country Music would add credibility to Spilsbury as The Lone Ranger The narration by Merle Haggard was just another annoyance that audiences had to deal with At times Haggard rhymes his narration and it sounds like some weird kiddie movie Combine the rhyming narration with the Ride Little Cowboy songs and any credibility that Spilsbury could have mustered was destroyed by Haggard and the soundtrackTonto was played by Michael Horse and as others have pointed out Horse had a lot more personality than Spilsbury In fact perhaps because of Spilsburys allegedly combative attitude during filming it seems like Horse was given a lot more dialogue and screen time than anyone would have expected of Tonto Tonto takes charge and often is the leader instead of the Lone Ranger I was expecting or hoping that Billy Jack would make a cameo as Tontos brother it would have made the movie a lot better Horse is not only more interesting than Spilsbury but he says more and has better scenes Perhaps it was a case of Horse stealing the show from Spilsbury However since the movie was so wretched Horse did not get much recognition Unlike Spilsbury Horse has had a very productive career in the film industryPerhaps the last negative about this movie is the Powder Blue outfit of The Lone Ranger The material that was chosen for Spilsbury was more powdery blue than what Clayton Moore normally wore at appearances That choice of color for the outfit just made Spilsbury look more effeminate in his role The comic book version had shown The Lone Ranger also wearing a red shirt and black pants and that alternative outfit would have helped Spilsbury look more convincing as The Lone RangerThe supporting cast mostly mailed in their performances They all look as if they were working on a TV episode and nobody seemed very convincing Even the villain Cavendish lost his edge due to the people around him Overall I feel sorry for Spilsbury Not only did he do a terrible acting job but it is obvious that the production and publicity were horrible and effectively sabotaged any chance the poor guy had Even if he had been an excellent replacement for Clayton Moore I doubt that the movie would have done well as a result of the other factors As it stands this film is funny in a sad way,0
This is a story about Shinae who moves to Milyang from Seoul with her young son Jun to start over after the accidental death of her husband Her husband was born here and she is opening up a piano school but also has ambitions to own some land with the insurance money she received from the death If that is what the film was about it probably would have been like a Hollywood film with her falling for some local guy and being happy with her son in their new home But this is not Hollywood Her son gets kidnapped and murdered ostensibly because it is known she has cash from the settlement The grief process attempts at moving on attempts to clear her conscience of guilt are all done admirably and the lead actress is superb The only caveat and it has to be stated is that this is a depressing film You have to know that going in You want Shinae to go through her grief and find some measure of happiness Again this is not Hollywood it is Korea and in Korean cinema especially drama they pull no punches Life is what happens to you Great acting but sometimes a tough film to watch due to the goings on If you stay youll be rewarded Do that,1
Burt Reynolds stars as an undercover cop who is after a crime boss Rachel Ward as the high price call girl he falls forBurt does well in this role and I think he wouldve done well in more roles like thisRachel Ward is beautiful and sexy in her partgood pacing and story but something is missing in the equation on a scale of one to ten7,1
Now maybe it had something to do with the fact that I saw this movie at a low point in my life when I was really trying to figure out where I was going and what I needed to make myself happy but this film really spoke to me Jane is an everywoman although she has so many positive things going for her she is still vulnerable and unhappy in her life She is strong and intelligent but she was cheated out of achieving her potential by an unfortunate accident and is living a secondchoice life She seeks out new challenges and happiness seeking desperately to fill the hole in her heart Dreya Weber is an exquisite Jane As we journey with her we feel the depth of her despair the torture of her desperation and eventually the strength of her conviction The beautiful Addie Yungmee is also very well cast and an asset to the production Allison Mackie is a scene stealer as a saucy character with impeccable timing I highly recommend this film although its low budget it has big budget writing and production values PS great aerial scenes with two beautiful sexy women Women will love the story and characters but theres something for the men here too,1
John Travolta the biggest honkeytonk in the world and a mechanical bullwhat more can you ask for Yeah youre probably not going to get many surprises or deep meaning in this one Yet I have always found it fairly enjoyable to watch this redneck romance Bud Travolta and Sissy Debra Winger meet at Gilleys and fall in love They have all the difficulties you might expect a hardcore redneck couple to have The honkeytonk scenes are fun with dancing mechanical bull riding and of course the required brawls It has a good 1980 country soundtrack featuring Looking for Love in All the Wrong Places The Devil Went Down to Georgia and Hello Texas by my favorite Jimmy Buffett Break out your cowboy boots and have a bootscootin boogie Out of 4,1
Let me get this straightHotshot plastic surgeon loses a patient on the operating table while removing a cyst from her face and ends up falling in love with recently separated bed and breakfast hostess within about 24 hours of meeting her due to her solid advice on bedside mannerWow Move over The Notebook theres a new kid in townWhere to begin Well how about the depth of this relationship I think we can safely sum up the foundation of this undying love in the following steps1 Exchange polite pleasantries over a bite of salad 2 Drink copious amounts of Jack Daniels play basketball with old food 3 Provide glib unsolicited advice to each other on your crappy lives 4 Make love during a hurricane 5 Devote your lives to each other via airmailI noticed George C Wolfe has The Hairball and United Kanye West Project in his dossier Would stick to your genre be too harsh Enough said I think most would agree that the best love stories make us cry or laugh or even hope But the reason they are able to do that is that somewhere during the storyline we really start to care about the characters were watching on screen To make us care there must be time spent developing these characterstheir lives their history why were watching them now Wolfe didnt seem to want to waste our time with such trivialities and instead provided us with all of about 8 minutes of background information on each character before hurling us into an intense oneonone interaction between two ACTORS weve all come to adore but two CHARACTERS we could care less aboutFor one brief tender moment when Richard Gere exclaims that he doesnt expect her to listen to his problems and she invites him for dinner the viewer sees a glimmer a beginning of something special between these two characters But instead of being allowed to enjoy the anticipation and playfulness of what happens next in the wonderful unpredictable joy that is courtship we are instead pushed headlong into a love affair between two people we hardly knowLets face it We have all heard cheesy one liners in Romantic films But the reason we cut some slack to Bogart in Casablanca or Nicholson in Somethings Gotta Give is because our hearts and minds have been lifted to the heavens and dragged through the mud and back again with these characters and by the time they deliver the line were so deeply involved with their plight we dont even notice the cheese factor Since Wolfe doesnt allow us to love or even like our protagonists all were left with a fromage sandwich and a few snickers in the audienceWolfe takes the old Hollywood directors phrase cut to the chase much too literally here As each stilted one liner is delivered by our cast the viewer is left wondering if director Wolfe is subliminally saying to the audience cmon its a Richard Gere romance just buy inIt is as a result of this stunning lack of character or relationship development that the films climax fails miserably to tug at our hearts When Geres character dies I felt like I was watching the news about someone I didnt know passing away Or watching a ladies eights rowing race during the beijing olympics Just Didnt CareEpic Fail,0
Saw this movie the first time while drunk at a motel in Canada While flipping through channels came across the Easy Lube part My friend kept flipping but I told him to go back Something about the name easy lube just didnt sound right Watched the rest of the movie it was pretty damn funny Jotted down a couple of names from the credits and got home to look it up Turned out to be Chevy Chases first movie I didnt remember him in it Didnt remember much about it so I rented it and gave it a second veiw Its pretty funny and quite graphic Its just like Kentucky Fried Movie except not as funny Love the fingers easy lube and Im da fkin president parts Dealers skit is pretty cool too I give it a 65 or 7 out of ten,1
Blade was a thrilling horror masterpiece and it was a brilliant movie with real great action I cant wait for Blade 2 This is one of Wesley Snipes greatest movies the acting is great the story line is great everything about this movie is great,1
A SHIRLEY TEMPLE Short SubjectIt can get mighty rough at Buttermilk Petes Cafe when the local contingency of diaperclad WAR BABIES come in for their midday milk breakThis primitive little film a spoof of military movies provides a few chuckles but little else tiny tots talking tough can begin to pall in a short time Shirley Temple playing a duplicitous hipswinging French miss hasnt much to do in this precelebrity performance Highlight the real signs of toddler temper when a few of the infants unexpectedly get well truly soaked with milkOften overlooked or neglected today the one and tworeel short subjects were useful to the Studios as important training grounds for new or burgeoning talents both in front behind the camera The dynamics for creating a successful short subject was completely different from that of a feature length film something akin to writing a topnotch short story rather than a novel Economical to produce in terms of both budget schedule and capable of portraying a wide range of material short subjects were the perfect complement to the Studios feature films,1
This film is absolutely horrific One of the worst movies Ive ever seen The story does nearly not exist the characters are full of stereotypes and the SpecialFX only make you laugh The only remarkable thing about this movie is the guest appearance of the Rapper Coolio as some kind of police officerIf this film was supposed to be a comedy I didnt quite get the point If you want to watch this movie please get yourself drunk first and then prepare for some good laughsespecially when the first SpecialFX appear on the screenBut if you like trash movies made on the cheap this film is a mustsee for you,0
May Contain Spoilers A few weeks after I had originally wrote my review for Hood of the Living Dead I realized that I may have been a bit too harsh on this movie Which is why I decided I would do something I had never done before Review the same movie again Dont get me wrong I still dont like the movie I still think its dreck and I still think the zombies dont look all that zombieish The story in the movie is still in my opinion weak and rather lame The story is about a guy named Rick who works as a scientist that just happens to be working on a serum thing that heals sick cells in animals and his brother Germaine the two arent exactly on the best of terms my my an original plot point and argue a lot One day Germaine is shot in a driveby shooting and Rick calls up his scientist buddy to bring the serum to try to resuscitate Germainewhereas most people wouldve called 911 but whatever naturally the serum fails and Germaine dies if that didnt happen thered have been no movie after the police and the coroner until the end of time I will still think that maybe the paramedics shouldve shown up leave the scene shows the coroner van which I still believe was just someones van with a coroner decal thrown on the side and Germaine returning to life to attack and kill the paramedics I would talk more about the plot but I feel that if I reveal more about the story you wouldnt want to watch it and we wouldnt want that now would we but suffice to say that the story in my opinion at least meanders and is rather slow moving pun not intended As Ive previously said in my review the zombies dont look all that much like zombies I still think they look like theyve been in a bar fight Thats not to say that they should all be decaying and whatnot but still there should at least be bite marks on the victims Also I still dont like the fact that the directors continually switch up the pace at which the zombies move They couldnt really seem to decide on whether or not to have the zombies run or shamble as most zombie movies do dont get me wrong Im all for running zombies but make up your minds people In one scene the zombie runs toward the living and in the other he just shambles to them And sometimes they just dont seem believable yes I know their fictitious creatures but still I am of course referring to the zombie that runs his hand on the wall as though he were walking through a dark living room and I still dont like the zombie who is lying on the ground gets shot then jerks like he was just shot The sound in the movie also bothered me mainly the music which while it may have just been my copy of the film seemed pretty much nonexistent Music in a movie is important folks Especially when the sound editing does sound like the director just took a friends camcorder and shot a little zombie flick The acting is still atrocious in my opinion and is on par with the American actors from the Japanese zombie movie Junk The movie is still bad almost House of the Dead bad its better no doubt about that but then again thats not saying much Its not the worst movie out there and it is better than a lot of direct to video movies that are out there but at the end of the day wasnt good I also think the movie moves really really slow despite the fact that it is only an hour and twenty or so minutes and yes I still dont like the opening song This is the type of movie I think is wellsuited to be premiered on the SciFi network Which is why I am obligated to give this debacle of a film a one out of ten But think of it this way at least its not a negative one,0
As a helpful warning for others I believe Skeleton Man is actually worse than Raptor Island I have been using RI as an example of the worst original movie presented on the SciFi channel but SM is the most laughably incoherent and wretchedly designed movie I have yet seen Yes I did watch almost the whole thing coming into it about 35 minutes into it It drew me in with its pure ineptitude What was SciFi thinking Once Skeleton Man and the surviving platoon leader or whatever he wasIm not good on military unit terminology reached the chemical plant the movie moved into a zone of impossible nonsense that was almost mesmerizing I had the same idea as another viewer who wondered if more than one movie had someone been edited together to make one terrible whole,0
Times I look back to high school and it amazes me that I never went lower than Marvin did in this BAD filmPoor Marv is the main character whos bad luck just gets worse and worse Despite his intelligence he manages to get bullied exploited supports his lousy deadbeat Dad and plenty more goofups including a daring heist which lets say doesnt go fully to plan Of course the viewer feels no empathy with anyone in this film so all this disastrous gloom bounces off like harmless zeta rays Recommended for those days youre feeling down pop this film in and youll smile and say Im so glad Im not Marv,0
I am not so much like Love Sick as I image Finally the film express sexual relationship of Alex kik Sandu their triangle love were full of intenseness frustration and jealous at last Alex waked up and realized that they would not have result and futureEnding up was sadThe director Tudor Giurgiu was in AMC theatre on Sunday 1200PM on 081006 with us watched the movie together After the movie he told the audiences that the purposed to create this film which was to express the sexual relationships of Romanian were kind of complicateOn my point of view sexual life is always complicated in everywhere I dont feel any particular impression and effect from the movie The love proceeding of Alex and Kiki and Kiki and her brother Sandu were kind of next door neighborhood storyThe two main reasons I dont like this movie are firstly the film didnt told us how they started to fall in love Sounds like after Alex moved into the building which Kiki was living then two girls are fall in love It doesnt make sense at all How a girl would fall in love with another girl instead of a man Too much fragments you need to image and connect those stories by your mind Secondly The whole film didnt have a scene of Alex and Kiks sexual intercourse that s what I was waiting for However it still had some parts were deserved to recommend The ear piercing part was kind of interesting Alex was willing to suffer the pain of ear piercing to appreciate kiks love That was a touching scene which gave you a little idea of their love Also the scene of they were lying in the soccer field the conversation express their loves were truthful and passionate,0
Spoiler alert although I think this one was spoiled coming out of the can Its hard to even imagine that a film with these stars from this studio made at this time period could be so awful but it is It is the films biggest flaw by far that it just doesnt make any damn senseRich widower American aristocrat Penn Gaylord leaves his small daughter in charge and goes off to World War I where he is killed Then we flash forward to present day 1942 and total confusion The three sisters are in court where they are said to have spent the last twenty years and some jerk named Barclay is trying to take their home away from them This is just the beginning of an endless series of unanswered questions that comprises the script more holes in it than The Warren Report What happened to the Gaylord fortune If the will is worth half a billion why has the family home gone from an opulent palace to the house on The Munsters Who the devil is this Barclay clown And why is he able to take someones home away from them The questions just pile on top of more questionsThe usually affable and charming George Brent is playing Barclay who is inexplicably a total sod tromping all over everyone taking whatever the heck he wants no matter who it belongs to and without a twinge of guilt yet no one besides Fiona Barbara Stanwick seems to particularly dislike this cretin Why None of these questions are ever answered We instead just follow Fionas life from one train wreck to another the evil Barclay takes away her home her fortune and even her child What does she do Shoot him Set him on fire No too logical In a completely improbably wrapup this woman whos only prior romantic involvement with Barclay was save for the technicality of marriage rape suddenly decides midsentence literally that she does not hate him she loves him And theyre going to live happily ever after All of a sudden for no reason in the world this early female role model of independence and authority is transformed into the usual helpless ankletwisting twit more commonly found in films of this era Yeah sure steal everything in the world that belongs to me and Ill fall in love with you On what planet does that happen I can only guess the reason I never heard of this film before I happened to catch it on Turner is that it was as lost on contemporary audiences as it is today,0
I have just sat through this film again and can only wonder if we will see the likes of films like this anymore The timeless music the tender voices of William Holden and Jennifer Jones leave this grown man weeping through joyous romantic scenes and Im not one who cries very often in life Where have our William Holdens gone and will they make these moving wonderful movies any more Its sad to have to realize that they probably wont but dont think about it just try to block that out of your mind Even so they wont have Holden in it and he wont appear on that hill just once more either You can only enjoy this film and watch it again,1
From the dire special effects onwards I was absolutely gob smacked at how bad anyone can make a film Lets put it this way I have absolutely no directing experience whatsoever and for the first time ever when watching a film I thought I can do better than that whilst sat watching this pap The acting in this film was terrible I suppose the best actor was the guy from Lawnmower Man but the French guy from Aliens3 was so wooden I wondered how he got the former job in the first place The storyline was mediocre and I suppose like most films If the rest had been done well it would have stood up I dont usually write reviews here but after seeing a couple of people gave this film a good rating must be castcrew I felt I had to say my piece to save anyone from accidentally hiring it or wasting their money on buying this cack,0
These days Ridley Scott is one of the top directors and producers and can command huge sums to helm moviesespecially since he has films like ALIEN GLADIATOR and BLADE RUNNER to his credit So from this partial list of his credits its obvious hes an amazing talent However if you watch this very early effort that he made while in film school youd probably have a hard time telling that he was destined for greatness Thats because although it has some nice camerawork and style the film is hopelessly dull and uninvolving However considering that it wasnt meant for general release and it was only a training ground then I am disposed to looking at it charitablyhence the score of 4By the way this film is part of the CINEMA 16 European Shorts DVD On this DVD are 16 shorts Most arent great though because it contains THE MAN WITHOUT A HEAD COPY SHOP RABBIT and WASP its an amazing DVD for lovers of short films and well worth buying,0
What was there about 1939 that helped produce so many excellent Hollywood films Well whatever it was the magic may also be found in this Columbia picture Its a long forgotten screwball comedy that Turner Classic Movies has begun to show Maltins movie book does not contain it In nearly every department Amazing Mr Williams is a jewelIts the story of a firstrate police detective who can never find the time to marry his intended As the wedding bells are about to ring he gets called to the scene of a murder The lady in question has to learn the hard way not only to enjoy the pursuit of criminals but to belong to the police force There are a lot of laughs in the processMelvyn Douglas proved again that he had few peers in light comedy Joan Blondell was at the peak of her career and is a delight Edward Brophy and Donald McBride are hilariousThe film goes on a bit too long but who cares The screwball comedies are always able to entertain and this film belongs right in there with the best,1
Rzone is an awful movie It is so simple It seems they tried to make a movie to show the reel life Just like Zappa did many years ago But unfortunately Denmark lacks good young actors Leon are by many still the little girl in krummernes Jul and Laura is simply not good enough to play such an important role several times in the movie she plays with out soul and this is destroying the movieEven though i consider it a movie you ought to see I do not agree that the youth are behaving like this but i think it can show how it can end if you are letting your child down Also it is important to support danish movies and new companies like Film folketall in all I think people should see Rzone Not because it is a great film but because it is a movies which is dealing with important themes I also think it is important to point out that there are some violent scenes in it and actually it is in these scenes Laura is acting best like the ending where she is holding the gun,0
OK this is one strange film Fans of Ed Wood Jr will appreciate the inventive techniques director George Barry utilizes like stock footage and cheesy voice overs He can make a crack in the wall into a plot device There is more humor than horror here but I found it an uneven blend You will be laughing and crying and probably wondering why you got your hands on this Barry explains in the introduction that filming began on this movie in 1972 and was completed in 1977 at a cost of 10000 Thats 59 months and 9900 too much If you like your cheese on the campy side with vintage 70s gore you might find this an irresistible and freaky snack,0
The scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years The characters are interesting even if a bit predictable The comedic timing written into the script is more than enough to make up for a wellworn underdog plot When youre sure you know the endingSURPRISE Highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular Great movie,1
I honestly had no idea that the Notorious BIG Bert I Gordon the director not the murdered rapper was still active in the 80s I always presumed the deliciously inept Empire of the Ants stood as his last masterful accomplishment in the horror genre but that was before my dirty little hands stumbled upon an ancient and dusty VHS copy of The Coming a totally obscure and unheard of witcherymovie that actually turned out a more or less pleasant surprise What starts out as a seemingly atmospheric tale of late Dark Ages soon takes a silly turn when a villager of year 1692 inexplicably becomes transferred to present day Salum Massachusetts and promptly attacks a girl in the history museum For you see this particular girl is the reincarnation of Ann Putman who was a bona fide evil girl in 1692 and falsely accused over twenty people of practicing witchcraft which led to their executions at the state The man who attacked Loreen lost his wife and daughter this and wants his overdue revenge But poor and three centuries older Loreen is just an innocent schoolgirl or is she Burned at the Stake unfolds like a mixture between The Exorcist and Witchfinder General with a tad bit of The Time Machine thrown in for good measure Way to go Bert The plot becomes sillier and more senseless with every new twist but at least it never transcends into complete boredom like too often the case in other contemporary witchcraft movies like The Dunwich Horror and The Devonsville Terror The film jumps back and forth between the events in present day and flashbacks of 1692 which keeps it rather amusing and fastpaced The Ann Putman girl is quite a fascinating character reminiscent of the Abigail Williams character in the more commonly known stage play The Crucible also depicted by Winona Ryder in the 1996 motion picture There are a couple of cool death sequences like the teacher in the graveyard or the journalist in the library that are committed by the ghost of malignant reverend who made a pact with Ann Putman and perhaps even the Devil himself The film gets pretty spastic and completely absurd near the end but overall theres some good cheesy fun to be had Plus the least you can say about Bert I Gordon is that he definitely build up some directorial competences over the years,0
THis was a hilarious movie and I would see it again and again It isnt a movie for someone who doesnt have a fun sense of a humor but for people who enoy comedy like Chris Rock its a perfect movie in my opinion It is really funnny,1
I really dont know much about the Marquis de Sade not having read any of his book but I never imagined him as a flaming queen Carson Kressley of Queer Eye For the Straight Guy or Jack from Will and Grace would have fit easily into the role that Nick Mancuso gave usThe movie itself was rather thin and seemed more of a parody or an excuse to show the Paris whorehouse several times with men and women having a good time on the couches in the parlor What They cant afford a room I did find it cute that the Madame Irina Malysheva felt she was doing her patriotic duty taking care of the soldiers needsThe movie was just an excuse to show a lot of breasts and I mean a lot Fans of Gimli John RhysDavies might be interested in seeing him in a different role as Inspector Marais,0
A fabulous film With everything you could want in a film Huge battle scenes and lots of other action Suspense and a romantic love story Kind of like an old swashbuckler film Totally entertaining from start to finish The editing was fast and you are never bored for a second The story is like a classic story of trouble in the Royal Household The actors are beautiful and the sets magnificent The costumes are spectacular and the stunt work is imaginative The special effects are amazing tooGary Stretch is really impressive as an actor and gorgeous to look at He looks like a sure bet for Super Stardom John RhysDavies is wonderful as he usually is He is one of the great actors of our timeAnd Cindy Burbridge Ex Miss Thailand is excellent and perfect for the leading lady even doing an English accent with remarkable success I found out that the film has won numerous awards and i can see whyAll in all this is an amazing Independent film See it for sure I highly recommend it And give it a TEN,1
PLOT IN A NUTSHELL Dave Seville father figure manager of the Chipmunk brothers Alvin Simon Theodore has gone off to Europe on a business trip leaving the boys at home with Miss Miller as their watcher much to the chagrin of Alvin who wanted to go to Europe While playing against his female counterpart Brittany the leader of the Chipettes comprised of her younger sisters Jeanette the female counterpart of Simon and Eleanor the female counterpart of Theodore in a fierce arcade game of Around the World in 30 Days they catch the attention of two evil foreign siblings who need to smuggle money diamonds around the world but need a way to do it that wont draw the attention of their arch enemy Jamal The 2 evil siblings Claudia Klaus overhear the banter between Alvin Brittany and decide to use them as the delivery boys girls for their loot more Claudias idea than Klauss the latter initially objects feeling that its too dangerous for children The 2 siblings make an offer to the boys girls travel via air balloons to 12 drop off points to leave dolls which resemble the kids that contain diamonds andor money to indicate their arrival with the promise that whoever wins the race will get an obscene amount of money But as the two different set of talking animal siblings make their rounds they are stalked by the henchmen of Jamal but who is Jamal Is he friend or foe OVERALL Enjoyable lighthearted farce based on the 1980s TV series version of Alvin the Chipmunks Beautiful animation is a highlight lacks the crude humor that keeps creeping into todays family films and engaging songs Boys Girls of Rock Roll being a stand out Eagle eyed fans will probably notice that Brittanys character design has been tweaked from the animated series giving her a less round face while adding a seemingly permanent blush to cheeks which Jeanette Eleanor also displayKeep an ear out for Nancy Cartwright the voice of Bart Simpson,1
Personally I LOVED TRIS MOVIE My best friend told me about it so i rented it out a watched it Its amazing The music the acting the story lines the emotion everything well except for one minor fact Absolutely no loyalty to the books at all I saw this movie before Interview with the Vampire and before i even knew the books existed so i was shocked to find how many people actually hated the movie I picked up quickly that the book fans werent at all happy with the unfaithfulness not wanting to be hypocritical I hate the Harry Potter movies due to lack of book loyaltyi stayed silent Eventually i picked up The Vampire Lestat and understood immediately why everyone hated it It is completely different The movie Queen of the damned is a combination of The Vampire Lestat and The Queen of the Damned But i still loved the movie from when i saw it before reading any of the books So if you havent seen this movie or read the book watch the movie first or youll hate it If you have read the book then you have every right to hate this movie,1
Crackerjack is a simple but feelgood movie where the good guys are very good and the bad guys are very bad and the central character is tempted by both sidesThe combination of the central character being played by Mick Malloy and the central setting being the local lawn bowls clubs drew an unusually broad crowd ranging from large numbers of teenagers to large numbers of senior citizens and all laughed at the comedyAs would be expected of a movie with Mick Malloy and Judith Lucy there was quite a bit of swearing but it was not overdone and the audience I sat with certainly enjoyed itMick Malloy did a good job as the lazy bloke who joined the bowls club three times simply to get parking spaces one for himself and two for leasing to others at a premium but who has everything fall down on him when he is required to play or lose his membershipJudith Lucy does a fine job as his local journalistloveinterest and there are fabulous performances from Bill Hunter Frank Wilson Monica Maughan Lois Ramsey and many othersJohn Clarkes dour role as the bad guy is not one of his funniest but he gives a solid performanceThe not so subtle swipes at pokies provide a bit of a serious note to this otherwise light comedyIm sure that those who enjoyed The Castle and The Dish would also enjoy this movie,1
Im a big fan of the true crime genre but I couldnt sit through this putrid piece It was almost as if Dahmer was intended as erotica down to the pornflic soundtrack There was no look at what made Dahmer tick no exploration of who his victims were Nothing but Look at how creepy this guy is And I have to give the filmmakers this much their Dahmer is the creepiest thing ever to disgrace the screen,0
I first saw this when it came out in the theater Though only 13 at the time I was an avid reader of hard science science fiction stories The technical gaffes of the film are burned into my memorySome of the following may have significant spoilersEven as a youngster I knew the premise is silly The rocket takes off for a lunar mission in a cosmos where there is always a gravitational effect on the crew though loose objects float as in zero gravity and because of that the cabin the area with the controls whatever they called it was gyrostabalized to maintain the correct orientation so that when they landed why didnt they land standing on their heads and where at least in nearearth space the rocket engines had to be running continually with propellant combusting away without an oxidizer When the engines quit the rocket stopped dead in space and couldnt start going until a PhD chemist determined it needed at a little oxidizer This time the rocket recalled it had momentum and the next thing our heroes know theyre near Mars even a 13yearold nerd knew such a minimumenergy trip would take over 200 daysThey land find the air was breathable though at the time scientific data revealed that the pressure even if the atmosphere were pure oxygen would be too low to do any good They decide to camp outside the ship and even build a campfire They come armed even though they were supposedly going to the Moon where firearms wouldnt be neededThey get a sight of a collapsed civilization encounter stray martians who look just like people develop an anti nuclear war philosophy and those who survive try to get back to the home planet and die in the attempt by crashing on the Earth To do that would require such a long orbital period theyd have died of starvation long before approaching their destinationThe film it preceded Destination Moon used real science most effectively even though their rescue with the Oxygen Tank forgot about the moment arm from the tanks center of gravity to the output nozzle This film showed woeful ignorance of even the most basic science Only the most technologically illiterate should think of it as a science fiction film its on a par with the old Flash Gordon serials where their rocketships took off from their bellies and climbed in spirals and whose engines were always onThe story on this one I considered banal and I can recommend this only as a film to be shown to students for them to pick out technical gaffes,0
I have lately got into the habit of purchasing any interesting DVD that the Criterion company releases I figure that even if I dislike the movie Criterion usually supplies enough extra material to compensate for any shortcomings in the actual film I read up on them and I buy the ones which are the most interesting to meLe Million is my latest purchase and I must say that I was not disappointed in the film It is cheery funny and romantic Everything about it is quite excellent The songs are wonderful If I understood French I would probably hum them and sing them all day long The acting is very good for this kind of movie American musicals of the classic Hollywood era relied more on song and dance than the actual characters and story but in Le Million the characters are rather well developed and the story while not being anything extremely impressive is not at all lacking I loved the developments of the relationships especially the relationship between the once best friends Michel and Prosper The romantic moments are also very well developed The direction is nearly perfect with several very memorable moments Probably the single most perfect scene of the film occurs right after the lead couple has an argument They hide on the stage of an opera performance and the opera singers sing lines which the couple Michel and Beatrice interpret to their own situation This is definitely one of the high points in cinema history The scene managed to make me laugh to win me over with a very sweet romance and make me smirk at just how clever the director was I give this film a 910PS Some information for anyone who has the same faith in Criterion that I do and is planning to buy it Amongst the Criterion discs I now own Le Million contains the fewest features All it has is a photo gallery not all that useful one might flip through it once and a rare television interview with Rene Clair the director This piece is of some interest He was one of the many directors who had started out in silent film and when talkies were first appearing he said that they represented the death of film I think most filmsavvy people understand what these directors meant when they said that but it is interesting to hear him explain it Also if you have read the description of this movie on Amazoncom please note that they were wrong in one important respect not every line in the film is sung In fact it contains no more songs than a regular musical It is actually a lot more like a Chaplin or Buster Keaton or Marx Brothers film My criticisms of the disc are not that important Heck Criterion has the right to smack me around for making those complaints The fact is their people probably spent hundreds of hours fixing up a film which only 20 now 21 people have voted for on imdb and only about a hundred people if that will ever see the film Heck if you look at the Criterion web site Le Million is nowhere to be found I have no clue why not Its something they should really be proud of of course their web site is surprisingly horrible They did a fine job on this film Bravo They deserve all the money I can stand to give them,1
The Standard bearer of all movie serials the definite good guy Flash Gordon versus Bad Guy Ming the Merciless Though the special effects seem awful by todays standards for 1936 they were top notch But the essence of the story is the battle between Earthman Flash Gordon Buster Crabbe versus Emporer Ming of Mongo Charles Middleton Crabbe and Middleton are terrific in their parts And the supporting characters playing Dale Arden Dr Zarkov Princess Aura Prince Barin Vulcan and the rest are all very good This serial is far superior to the 1980 movie basically because Crabbe is much much superior to Sam J Jones as Flash GordonThis serial is the standard bearer for all movie serials No question about it,1
Diary of Sex Addict is a pathetic attempt at a serious drama about sexual compulsiveness Probably a movie marketing scam this flick is a stylish shoot with a good cast and little else going for it Bottom line Diary would have us believe that our sex addict character has the dumbest wife in the world a stable of babes on the side who have nothing better to do than drop their panties for him at his whim and no job in spite of being a restaurateur At the best this flick could have been good drama At the worst cheap softcore Diary isnt either and nowhere in between This ones for the dumpster D,0
I cant believe that someone actually paid to have this film made Stupid unrealistic and stereotypical Right from the take off of the massive 747 the pilot pulled the throttles back to increase speed then you have 5 armed persons with semi to fully automatic weapons firing without so much as one bullet breaching the walls of the pressurized cabin at 38000 feet Then once below in the belly of the plane a stray bullet hits a FUEL line and we see the fuel leaking from the side of the plane The acting was just horrid and forced There just didnt seem to be any direction I have seen some pretty horrid B movies in my lifetime but with the names that were in this film I was extremely disappointed,0
I was hugely impressed with this movie if for nothing else than for the comedy It might not be the edgiest wittiest humor at all times but I found it appropriate to every sceneThe flow of the film is certainly a bit jumbled almost confusing sometimes but that is how the characters feel Sometimes were watching a bit of slapstick and other scenes revolve around a decisive discourse on relationships This might be a bit frustrating to certain viewers but it brought me closer to the characters dilemmas of irregular chaosThe acting is great from everyone Im a huge Andy Richter fan but I wasnt head over heels for his part like everyone else seems to be He did very well but Julianne Nicholson and Lauren Graham stole the show for me both in their respective ways Jay Mohr performs as expected if youve seen him in other films Ive always liked himOverall the movie is very funny and offers some nice foundations for a few types of relationships When it comes to relationship questions and problems some films try to surprise Theres nothing surprising about the conclusions offered here but its entertaining to watch them be revealed throughout the film,1
European Vacation aka National Lampoons European Vacation is the weakest of the Vacation films the first and third one the most superior of the films While Chevy Chase and Beverly DAngelo return as Clark and Ellen Griswold with new actors in the roles of Russ and Audrey Griswold this time they are given a weaker script with very bad dialogue This causes the pacing to suffer with the jokes not very funny at all To be more specific what really causes this film to suffer is the fact that the jokes as they are are just pasted together into a cobbledtogether script rather than serving a central plot as the other 3 Vacation films have Oh well they cant win them all 4 out of 10,0
Fabulous film Rented the DVD recently and was floored by this stunning piece of work Douglas Sirk was a filmmaking genius and he gets performances out of Rock Hudson Dorothy Malone Oscar winner Robert Stack Oscar nominated and Lauren Bacall that words cannot describe Paul Verhoeven brilliantly payed homage to this film by having Dorothy Malone play Sharon Stones murdering inspirational guru in his Basic Instinct What a great joke By turns the film is hilarious riveting campy biting trashy compelling and eye rolling Its definately the grandaddy of every tawdry bigandlittle screen soap opera but none have had the dazzling style like youll see here the camera work is smooth and polished the use of color is breathtaking the opening montage set to the title song is beyond memorable the one dimensional characters are unforgettable and the final image will have you scratching your head as to how the censors back then let it make the final cut While most older highly regarded films can sometimes be a boring chore to sit through Written on the Wind contains so much and goes by so fast that its actually a shame when it ends Thank you to Mr Sirk for crafting and Todd Haynes for drawing attention to what has now become one of my favorite films of all time SEE THIS MOVIE,1
I really cant say anything bad or good about this thing Its characters are likable enough its capably produced and designed and professionallooking except for that cheesy monster suit However it has no originality no ideas and nothing you havent seen in ALIEN PREDATOR ARMAGEDDON andor OUTLAND Its just another formula cookiecutter grimy corporate drones in deep space versus unstoppable monster flick Pretty much a waste of time,0
I was permanently scarred by this terrible filmThe main action of the movie is nothing special It seems theres a tribe of snakeworshipping people in a remote mountain region of Northern China where women rather than men are the leaders and decision makers I suppose among some men this is enough to make Succubare a horror movie Anyway occasionally Chinese men would wander into the village take a fancy to the local girls seduce them and then abandon them Unfortunately for the men the women had put them under a spell derived from snake venom which would make them die horribly in 100 days their bellies swollen like a pregnant womans with live worms and snakes if they did not returnForget the cover of the US video This has nothing to do with vampires though there is one inept blooddrinking scene The title itself is only marginally appropriate Succubare is the Latin verb meaning to lie beneath and its the root of the word Succubus a female demon who would seduce men in their sleep Actually its the MEN who are the seducers hereBut its not the main action of this ludicrous film thats so objectionable Its the little sideincidents Ill overlook the slaughter and butchery of an ox thats performed onscreen The participants seem very experienced as though this is an unpleasant duty they actually do in real life and Im sure they really ate the animal afterwards though I resent having the act thrust in my face as entertainmentWhat I WISH I could overlook or HAD overlooked are the numerous totally extraneous shots of an unidentified man who from time to time interrupts the story by eating living animals He starts the movie by tearing apart a live snake with his teeth In the course of the movie he devours a bug a lizard a toad I had to leave the room after this and a whole mouse I stopped watching at this point and lost my appetite for days Let me stress that this was totally unexpected and had nothing to do with the movie unless its a cynical reference to love as its portrayed in the film a blind selfish predatory survival mechanism that tears apart the helpless but then again Im probably just rationalizing to get the vileness out of my head,0
Oh dear Some of the best talent in British TV made this serial and so I can only assume that they were working under incredible time pressure and had to settle for first takes of many scenesThere ARE some frightening scenes in this Highland mystery mostly when the monster attacks and we see it from his point of view but Im afraid that I found most of the story unintentionally funny Such as the moment when the hero discovers a dismembered corpse on a golf course Oh look theres a hand oh and theres another hand over there hmm this is a bit puzzling For many years fans of British cult TV shows campaigned to have this serial released on VHS or DVD but the BBC always said no Now I think I understand why,0
Another of many nearly forgotten movies cranked out by Poverty Row in the 1930s resurrected by the magic of DVDStarring stock Universal player Lionel Atwill often a supporting actor in numerous Frankenstein movies as a pair of twins involved in a murder racket One kills the victims stockbrokers involved in a scam and asks witnesses for the exact time while the other is deaf and is proved innocent because he could not have spoken to witnessesOf course where it falls apart is if it was a congenital deafness wouldnt they both be deaf Oh wellAtwill does a pretty good job here faking being deaf and mute Unfortunately no one else here can really act worth a darn,0
Poor performances by Sinatra Martin and Hyer Grossly underdeveloped supporting characters Annoying talky with no real plot Ending leaves you flatter than a pancake with more loose ends than you could tie up in four sequels that is if you even cared about these wooden characters MacLaine is the only real asset That penultimate sequence in which the Chicago hood searches for the Sinatra character is laughable The music in that sequence also is poor And in the final scene when Martins character removes his hat for the woman he called a pig almost made me go outside and find a stone to throw through my television screen,0
I must admit at first I wasnt expecting anything good at all I was only expecting a cheesy movie promoting Gackts and Hydes image but Im glad to say it has much more to offerYes the acting is not that great but it doesnt suck either all the casts well disciplined and they bring enough strength to their characters Effects lack consistency but action scenes are satisfying enoughWhat really hooked me up was the essence of the storyline although it merges fantastic elements it also displays a crude reality The developing of the characters their doubts and their feelings really got on to me and I think thats the key of this movie It puts you to think and it does well transmitting all the angstIt fulfills any expectations for a good drama I would definitely recommend it to everyone,1
I dont know what some of you are smoking but i suspect its potentTo call Swept Away awful would be an insult to the very concept of terribleness The acting is hideous and im not picking on Madonna here we all know shes useless but someone should have warned everyone else that her ailment is contagious My back literally hurts from cringing so much at poorly delivered lines The editing is so sloppy it beggars description The photography and composition which in this era competence should be a GIVEN for any film with a budget are astonishingly inept even the lighting is horrid and unnatural looking These are BASIC elements of filmmaking if you cant get them right you should seek another line of work Its as contrived as a grade 3 production of Snow White except nowhere near as well made or interestingThe original film by Lina Wertmueller is a wonderful satire and metaphor superbly acted and written featuring breathtaking visuals you can practically taste the sea salt and feel the windswept sand in your hair The sexual tension feels real and immediatethose of you who found Guy Ritchies version deplorable should see it it really is one of the landmarks of world cinemaThose of you who thought the remake is some kind of masterpiece should have your heads examined,0
I have watched this movie on and off since it started playing about 1 hour ago and i have to say thats an hour of my life i wasted and will not be getting back The acting is crap and the scripts need a serious look at and whoever wrote them needs to be slapped perhaps the TV will explode and put me out of my misery The only good thing about this movie is that for guys and girls it has some good eye candy in it though most of which i wish would disappear as far as the movie is concerned the special effects as sht Dante who thinks a guy dressed in skin tight leather pants and half a leather jacket is scary he looks more feminine than most of the women in this movie the voice of Dante is pathetic nobody finds it threatening or scary AT ALL please TV i beg you to blow up,0
I like Billy Crystal and I thought it would be fun to watch this film since I know he admired Alan King and they would be funny together I thought I had seen all Billys movies but couldnt remember this one and now I know why Its so full of clichs and phony emotion you can smell each scene coming and going Billy doesnt even get to be funny very often Hes too busy trying to cry fake tears or show his angst at how badly his father let him down Alan King himself is fairly likable as is the subplot about being an extra in the movies But what a coincidence that Billy just happens to visit his father just as a major health crisis takes place etc etc Or that two busy doctors can just shut down their practices to moon around in LA And when the end comes boy does it come quickly Almost as though the writers realized they had painted themselves into a corner and the only way out was to do a death scene Mostly disappointing with a few glimmers of good humor,0
The US appear to run the UK police who all run around armed to the teeth and did you know that CID officers change into uniform when they stop work and go down the pub This has got to be one of the most unrealistic films with the worst portrayal of real UK police that has ever been foisted on the unsuspecting public I can see that Mr Snipes might have needed the money to pay his back tax bill but what the heck a good actor like Charles Dance was doing in it is a mysteryWorse than the worse low budget B film of the 50s An hour and a half of suicide and time I will never get backAvoid it like the veritable plague,0
I hardly know where to begin in writing about this gem except to say that it represents young Buster Keaton at the peak of his powers and must certainly rank with the halfdozen best short comedies ever made THE GOAT is twenty minutes of smoothly paced expertly photographed beautifully executed gags two reels of nonstop comic invention driven by an unmistakable undercurrent of paranoia and yet somehow leading to a happy ending which wasnt always the way with Busters comedies See COPS for one case where Fatalism ultimately got the better of him or ONE WEEK for the victory of Defeatism If I had to describe this film in one word Id call it effortless but if I were permitted two Id call it seemingly effortless for surely a lot of hard labor goes into the making of any comic opus that unfolds with such sublime ease Still they didnt call him the Great Stone Face for nothing Buster never let the public see him sweatA sardonic title card tells us that our opening sequence is set along Millionaires Row ie on a bread line in a grim urban setting where Buster waits patiently at the back of the line and as a result doesnt get fed But it needs to be emphasized that not for one moment does he play for pathos Buster has our sympathy but he never asks for it Before long through a series of accidents coincidences and absurd misunderstandings Buster is believed to be an escaped killer named Dead Shot Dan and is being pursued by every cop for miles around and yet while hes clearly dismayed by this turn of events there is never a hint of selfpity or even surprise we get the sense he always knew that this is what life would have in store for him and that he hasnt time to feel sorry for himself anyway he has to figure out new ways to dodge those cops and escape from the latest trapJust as Buster refrains from playing for sympathy he never seems to strain for laughs either which is especially impressive because THE GOAT must be one of the most laughpacked short comedies in existence This is the film that features that iconic shot of Buster riding a trains cowcatcher right up to the very lens of the camera which isnt a gag exactly but sure is laughprovoking in its own strange way Meanwhile there are gags involving guns dogs cops an incredibly furry mustache and a clay statue of a horse that melts under Busters weight a surreal sight indeed but some of the biggest boffos are saved for the finale when Buster is trying to elude his primary nemesis Big Joe Roberts a rotund cop who also happens to be the father of leading lady Virginia Fox Trapped in Big Joes dining room Buster leapfrogs over him and sails through a transom turns a phonebooth into an elevator and pretends to disappear and eventually uses the elevator itself to rid himself of his pursuer and win the girl in time for one last fadeout gagTo say more would be a disservice to firsttime viewers I only wish I could see this film in a theater full of people whod never seen it before and float on the laughter Live musical accompaniment would be nice too and incidentally the musical score supplied by Kino for their home videoDVD version of THE GOAT is firstrate serving as icing on an already tasty cake,1
I just saw this movie today with my children son 10 and daughter 45 at the 3rd Annual Roger Ebert Overlooked Film Festival After the film the children in the audience were allowed to ask questions to the Director TianMing Wu He through a translator told several stories about his life and the making of the filmAll tangents aside both of my children really enjoyed this movie Of course I had to paraphrase many of the subtitles for my daughter but much of the film is visually selfexplanatoryI wont give anything away but the bottom line is that this film is SO MUCH better than 95 of the Hollywood crap especially childrens films out thereCheersps There is a realoriginal King of Masks who cancould do 12 masks at once The actor in the movie trained and learned to do up to 4 masks at a time then they would cut and change to 4 new masks,1
Just saw this movie today at the Seattle International Film Festival and enjoyed it thoroughlyGreat writing and direction excellent and believable interaction among the cast and great comic timing as wellThis movie touches on themes that are universalfamily and separation As a result I can see European Asian and American audiences all finding points of similarity between this film and their own livesIf all that wasnt enough this has the potential to be the best underground date movie of the yearsomebody distribute this in the USA pleaseFinally thank you Maria Flom It really is a great film,1
First of all this plot is way overdone girl wants to make it everyone loves her snobby girl intervenes all looks lost girl pulls through everyone loves her again etc Throw in the fitting in thing an attractive male crushing on the heroine plus singleparent troubles and its so predictable that you can practically recite along with itSecond of all I really hate how they keep on dissing classical music They send out the message that everyone involved in classical music is uptight and snobby and closeminded in fact I dont recall the quote exactly but I remember at one point in the movie Holly says Why do they have to be so uptightso classical Its really insulting how label classical music in this wayThird Ive went over it dozens of times but the only reason that I can think of for making this movie is to promote Britney Spears there just isnt any point at allAnd oh yeah while the actress who portrayed Holly Im not sure whether that was really her singing or not had a reasonably good voice it wasnt as amazing as they were making it out to be especially when she was belting She was oversupporting the whole time110 stars,0
I watched the this the other night on a local station because I didnt feel like watching tripe like American Idol Peter Strauss gives a great performance as a convict named Rain Murphy who keeps to himself He admits to his crime and makes no bones that he feels no shame for it His cell is bare of any comforts that other inmates have like books and pictures The only time he feels in another zone is in running He does it often and can run a mile in under four minutes When a college coach hears about this he wants to prime him for a shot at the Olympics At first Rain wants no part of this but when his best friend is killed he shows interestThis is a good movie period Strauss is very good What did you expect anything less and Michael Mann shows hints of greatness that would come full bloom years later This movie had that bit of realism probably because it was filmed among convicts It almost feels like this was a true story The additional casting is good There is a lot of notable names like Brian Dennehy Roger E Mosley and Richard Moll as wellMy heart sank when some pompous board of directors wouldnt let him run because he didnt feel bad for his crime His final act made me stand up and cheer When they took his dreams away he took them back hard This was back when TV movies were actually good The Jericho Mile is a gem of a film ESPN Classic PLEASE SHOW THIS FILM,1
I kind of like Bam Margera so I was curious But watching a home production with somebody elses friends and family with a decent camera and a sound guy just isnt good filmmaking Writing direction acting and editing is abysmal at best But I sat through half of it And whyThis film gives perfect examples of what not to do it is a film students dream of what to avoid at every stage of the process Cram it into film school curiculums all over the jointSo thanx Bam Now I know Jackass is for real cause you aint looking to win an Oscar dude,0
this movie makes me laugh by even just thinking about it such a smart comedy very precise yet easy the casting can not be any better all actors are the best choice of their roles and they all play precisely the best and there is no stupid laughs or shouting through out the whole movie layers and the progress of story work perfectly together and the rhythm flow smoothly the greatest of all is when the Village Peoples YMCA is cued in it brings out the importance of the Indians statute which was only briefly brought up previously in the movie which makes the smartest and funniest climax among many comedies I give it a ten especially a lot of times comedies are so underrated,1
Given how corny these movies are you gotta figure that they must have had fun making them The movie focuses on a house that strangely accommodates whomever lives there The inhabitants were author Charles Hillyer Denholm Elliott with hair who gets haunted by one of his own creations Philip Grayson Peter Cushing who gets a little too close to a wax statue John Reid Christopher Lee whose daughters cuteness is apparently a facade and actor Paul Henderson Jon Pertwee on the verge of getting a little too much into characterThe House That Dripped Blood is actually worth seeing well duh it stars Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee Aside from just being neat there might be some undertones it might be calling into question the issue of real horror vs assumed horror Like in The Shining we might ask whether the househotel itself holds some memory of past events And if absolutely nothing else Ingrid Pitt as Pauls costar is HOT HOT HOT Around the time that this came out she also starred in Countess Dracula and The Vampire Lovers also with Peter Cushing Maybe she like Barbara Steele will remain known only as a scream queen but mark my words SHE IS A HOT SCREAM QUEEN Id like to see Ingrid Pitt and Barbara Steele costar in somethingI guess that the only weird scene so to speak is where Denholm Elliott is wearing a pink shirt and fluffy jacket You read that right What kind of a name is Denholm anyway Oh well A very cool movie,1
There are about ten minutes about half way through Strangeland when one suddenly sees the glimmer of an interesting idea Themes of revenge and rehabilitation come into focus during Robert Englunds brief screen time Sadly Strangeland then resumes its course as a thoroughly predictable and boring slasher film,0
Dont kill me fans but I have something to say about thisPros Well the most mildly interesting season that Ive watched out of all the seasons that are out there of Inuyasha just has tobe the Shichinintai arc Unlike the rest of the seasons I personally think that this one has more of a real plot line and those mercenaries good god theyre such likable characters Shame they were killed off Of course I would write a 15 page essay one why I like the Shichinintai so much but that would be boring for some of you So this series actually does have some likable characters Ill miss Bankotsu poor poor psycho little boyCons Outside of Shichinintai arc the series was overall boring repetitive and some of the characters are extremely irritating Kagome for example She overreacts too much to my taste she acts like Yuka from Elfen Lied Inuyasha Hes a loud mouth dog demon with a huge sword Whats so unique about him He has ADORABLE DOG EARS Tch Sesshomaru is all talk no action and very cocky Naraku has just got to be the wimpiest villain that ever existed in the anime world Miroku and Sango they have some color but they just seem to stand on the sidelines too much But what bugs me the most if the fact that they have absolutely no COMMON SENSE at all Rumiko Takahashi has done a LOT better then this Ive seen it beforeIf you like series with a lot of action no annoying love triangle no over repetitiveness this is not for you then,0
I loved this movie Great storyline and actors and good movie sets It told the story in a way I can easily understand and pay attention to without falling asleep I would like to know where I could get the soundtrack I can not find it anywhere Please email me if you know where I could get the soundtrack Other than not being able to find the soundtrack I thought the movie was fascinating Swayze did a great job I think this is some of his best work His past movies were OK but this one really told a story for a change This will go down in history as being one of the best TV films ever aired Congrats to the producers and writers of such a great piece of work,1
This first and hopefully not last Wallace Gromit feature lives up to expectations There are plenty of jokes some a bit cheeky as well as some great tributes to past Science Fiction movies With the barrage of awful and formulaic movies being spewed forth from Hollywood its great to see such a great film like this thats enjoyable for almost everyone If there is any justice it will be top of the boxoffice and be at least nominated for best animation at the next Oscars The animation is wonderful the characters are remarkably expressive and their adventures are great fun This is one of those films that the whole family can enjoy Charming clever fun and well made whats not to enjoy,1
This movie truly shows the farce and hypocrisy of Indian society What it tries to show you is only ONE side of the story The other side of the story is the hidden emotional and mental abuse of Indian children which this movie does not showIndian Parents are culpable for the following a Destroying the individuality of the children by making them completely dependent on the parents at a very early age Such children grow up to be Adults only in physical looks but remain children in minds Since everything has been provided to them by their great Indian parents They children automatically do not feel the need to work hard at something or learn the basics of human communication with other human beings apart from their parentsB I can show you so many Indian parents who try to prevent their kids making friends going out or prevent them to do anything which starts making them to grow into adultsThe reason why they do is the same selfishness Indian parents expect their children to take care of them when they grow old They do no savings for themselves and once they reach the age of 50They cry out LOUDWe have grown old now and so we are dependent on you children since we have done the GREAT SERVICE of bringing you to this world and taking care of you and making you intellectually weakMost of the Indian parents at the age of 50 have dilapidated bodies and health and are financially completely insecure Most feel that they ABSOLUTELY have no need to take care of themselves since they expect their kids to take care of themIn the west the opposite of that happens People start planning at the age of 20 about their retirement and once they retire they are financially secureIndian parents do NOTHING of that sort since like I said they have brought the kids in the world and what better investment at thatI am a victim of my Indian parents i am sure there are countless other Indian kids like me who have grown up physically but are still struggling with their lives on THEIR OWN and they continue to have pestering 50 year olds who cry out loud for HELP all the timeThis movie shows only ONE side of the storyUTTER piece of JUNK,0
These guys combine lowbrow with lowbudget Its gloriousLook if you want Bergman rent 7th Seal or something If you want to see grossout humor and exploitation sex this is the oneI think Jane Jensen as Julia makes it all watchable She can actually act really well shes a complete dreamboat and she doesnt seem to feel above it all,1
Okay here is a really short review this movie blowed I wish I could just have a review that stated this simple principle but I must bore you with more bad review type words like horrible clichd and unwatchable Its the type of film you watch when you are drunk or are stuck on a desert island with nothing else to do Heres the premise the vice president is captured by a terrorist group at a playoff hockey game and only Van Damm can stop the madness Truly truly terrible but then again I didnt pay to see it the first time around and only my dad felt the absence of girth in his wallet after this movie I hate the fact he is a Republican and all but then again he did spare me the horror of paying for this piece of garbage Okay that is now enough space to be recognized as a review so I bid adieu,0
Being a HUGE fan of the bottom series i was really looking forward to the release of this filmI was eagerly anticipating a laugh a minute rollercoaster ridealasWhere to start on this messi think its a good start to say that its hardly richie and eddie on our screens in the first place as none of the jokes and one liners they usually deliver so well are funnyI was still waiting for the first laugh after a good 20 minutes of viewingMany aspects of the story were pathetic and it was as if the film was full of those bad moments they rehearsed and decided to leave out of the final cutThe overall sets and atmosphere surrounding the film is dark and dingy which i suppose is good if they want to portray the terrible guest house the 2 buffoons attempt to runbut to me its just puts an even higher dampener on a sorry state of filming that should never have been createdThe actingat timesis patheticFenella Fielding is wasted as the loony Mrs Foxfur and ive seen Simon Pegg have much better outingsId recommend Guest House Paradiso to anybody who is blind drunk because they might appreciate the terrible puns much moreBut to any bottom fan who hasnt seen this film and is expecting true richie and eddie action you have been warned,0
Being a child of the 1980s I grew up with numerous educational as well as diversionary programs or both and continue to learn so much from them now that I admire the wisdom of those who worked on them After learning that Sesame Street to name the best example was not solely responsible for the fact that I could read at an adult level before I could walk it only increased the level of disgust I feel not only towards the Lyons corporation and its product but those who defend them too As if I had faith in those we assign to protect us or our children to begin with the fact that Barney Friends still pollutes our airwaves after more than a decade later is a discredit not only to the FCC American commerce and its makers it is a discredit to all of humanity In a world where I can be harassed without recourse by the police welfare services and child protection agencies simply for being born different to those in power yet broadcasters are allowed to pump this drivel into my home uncontested you have to ask what is wrong with peopleYou see in a world where we are expected to behave like adults and account for ourselves what we say to our sons and daughters is of importance because it will often have consequences long after we are gone Not only are our attempts to make our children more normal more alike more thinkalike potentially devastating what we end up teaching them to be normal has a big part to play too So the question becomes one of what Barney is teaching our children to be normal Apart from lessons such as that we are not good if we do not have good feelings or that someone will change the rules to make us happy when we come up short other shocking things we are shown on the Barney show include Barney molesting children The issue of child abduction and child molestation is a big one in our society and has been ever since we started trying to pretend it was not but that would qualify as one of the most inappropriate ways in which to present the topicSo far I have only mentioned the inappropriate and emotionally damaging lessons Barney himself presents Adding to the problem is the children shown on the show I use the word children loosely here as the range of ages shown goes as low as three years and as high as fourteen Yet no difference in emotional response is shown at either extreme Fourteen year olds react to Barney and his proposed situations in the exact same way as five year olds Experts in childhood and adolescent autism especially consider this an incredibly foul thing to expose children to Adults on the autistic spectrum who faced increasing problems as their needs were not only not met but flatout ignored have a tendency to watch this and feel an urge to do the kinds of things with Barney that would make fourteen year olds cry As irreverent and sick as shows targeted toward the elderchild market such as You Cant Do That On Television were they stamp all over Barney by demonstrating that not only do different ages respond to the same thing in different ways so too do different peopleSo in response to mdmireles1295 I have to say that I hope like hell they do not have children For every time I see a parent showing their child this drivel it gives me an overwhelming urge to report them to the police for child abuse And I speak as a man whose entire upbringing was dominated by abuse They might sing about manners loving caring or sharing but the examples they show are not only so lopsided as to be the opposite of educational they are so devoid of realism as to become dangerous as The Light Triton has already pointed out The kind of lessons children learn from Barney are that people do not vary feelings must be suppressed at all costs and rules are entirely arbitrary When compared to the lessons that variation is what makes the world go around and even the most bitter feelings have a purpose that television taught me as a boy it still boggles the mind that the authorities have yet to step in and yank this trash off the air If a parent did to their child what Barney does around the world they would face criminal chargesHence I gave Barney my favourite two out of ten score that I give to all rubbish with absolutely no redeeming value In a world of adults that know how to properly respond to their children it has no place,0
I remember seeing this film when it first came out in 1982 loved it then About 4 years later I had the privilege of seeing Luciano Pavarotti sing at the Metropolitan Opera house in New York in Tosca so seeing the ending of this film reminds me very much of that great night Whats not to like about this film The music is brilliant and Pavarotti Fini was at his best and still looked great The story is actually very funny in parts the food fight scene is still one of the funniest I have ever seen The hot air balloon flight over the Napa valley was beautiful so was the song he sang If we were in love one of the few times Pavarotti sang in English And hearing the duet of Santa Lucia gorgeous Get real folks this was a film about an opera singer called Georgio Fini who just happened to be played by Pavarotti Kathryn Harrold Eddie Albert were excellent in their supporting rolesI am VERY glad that I still have this almost worn out VHS tape of this movie but I would love this to be released on DVD especially now that Pavarotti is no longer with us because I think this includes the best performance of Nessun Dorma sung by him still on film today,1
I have just seen Caribe a couple of nights ago at the annual Vistas Film Festival held here in Dallas and I must express my discontent The opening caption tries to tell us that the film is a portrayal of the current invasion of South American countries Costa Rica in this particular case by North American oil companies and the negative effects both economic and environmental of this invasion The main characters are a married couple who live a simple pleasant life maintaining a banana farm Right away a woman arrives and announces that she is the wifes halfsister Im not going to go into specifics about this and to be honest I dont feel that Im spoiling anything with this review yet another key point is that the company to whom they distribute their bananas drops them due to budget demands in a poor economy So the main conflict that is supposed to be addressed in the movie is of the husband between the rock and the hard place trying to preserve his livelihood On one hand the Reynolds oil company has basically offered him employment and financial compensation basically a bribe to use his public influence to encourage the town to allow the company to begin drilling in their town compromising his standing with the community and the community itself On the other hand he is faced with being dead broke but on the side of his community protesting the drilling Given the length of this film it would have been ample time to explore the issues just described but it just doesnt happen and Ill tell you why You will notice that this film has won a couple of awards so far one for direction and an audience award Im not going to pick apart Estebans direction it wasnt bad or good enough for me to be all that passionate about writing anything The audience award was at a film festival in Spain and for it to gain an audience award Id have to imagine that Spanish people just dig soap operas In fact Central and South America dig soap operas as well I know that much I assume that Esteban was either aiming to take advantage of this or that he himself digs soap operas because that is what unfolds over the course of this film so much to the point that it kicks the whole oil company plot to the side almost as if they imagined halfway through the making of this film that it had become tiresome because it seems like at least three of the supporting characters have had their back story and character development severely compromised to make room for more sex and crying scenes The only true villain in the movie is one of these three characters and at no point do you actually get to find out who the hell he is Its almost as if they cut his screen time just short of taking him out of the film entirely From time to time they toy with the oil against community plot but these are digressions at best What we see a lot more of are scenes of passion jealousy betrayal adultery etc These themes saturate the story to such a degree that the oil company subplot becomes unnecessary Its almost as if this was a stunt to legitimize a romantic drama soap opera by throwing in a little political relevance Nevertheless the film gets so caught up in the romance that it ultimately doesnt know what to do with itself resulting in an ending so tacked on that youre left wondering what it is that youve been waiting around for or if there was ever anything to begin with Here are two things that I think could have saved this movie either cut out the halfsister or cut out the oil company Its obvious which one of the two they were more interested in Or perhaps if Caribe had been an hour longer they could have worked this all out Regardless Id have been fine with a straightup soap opera and I think that the subject of oil companies exploiting foreign nations is in dire need of addressing by the film community Caribe is both and neither These two angles could have worked together had they been balanced accordingly but with a romantic plot running around in circles and taking up almost twice as much time as necessary at the expense of an oil plot thats barely been established to begin with both sides suffer Best of all the romance plot is never even resolved Id like to say Id watch this movie again to see what Ive missed but I have a strong feeling that I already know what it is As far as Im concerned it wouldnt matter if I saw Caribe ten more times Ive missed it because it is simply not there,0
There was a Bugs Bunny cartoon titled Baby Buggy Bunny that was EXACTLY this plot Babyfaced Finster robbed a bank and the money in the carriage rolled away and fell into Bugs rabbit hole He dressed up as a baby to get into Buggs hole to retrieve the money The scene in Little Man where hes looking in the bathroom mirror shaving with a cigar in his mouth is straight from the cartoon This was a hilarious 5minute cartoon not so much an entire movie If you are really interested in this buy the Bugs Bunny DVD Its was much more original the first time 1954 Plus youll get a lot more classic Bugs Bunny cartoons to boot,0
OK so the musical pieces were poorly written and generally poorly sung though Walken and Marner particularly Walken sounded pretty good And so they shattered the fourth wall at the end by having the king and his nobles sing about the battle with the ogre and praise the efforts of Puss in Boots when they by rights shouldnt have even known about itWho cares Its Christopher Freakin Walken doing a movie based on a fairy tale and he sings and dances His acting style fits the role very well as the devious mischievous Puss who seems to get his master into deeper and deeper trouble but in fact has a plan hes thought about seven or eight moves in advance And if youve ever seen Walken in any of his villainous roles you know the ogre bit the dust HARD at the end when Walken got him into his trapA fun film and a mustsee for anyone who enjoys the unique style of Christopher Walken,1
Ineffectual mollycoddled selfpitying lousy provider Jimmy Stewart is having a bad marriage to Carole Lombard After falling on hard times he endures a demeaning job a faultfinding passiveaggressive overbearing livein mother who is in dire need of an epic smackdown and an endlesslycrying baby The movie trowels on failure and squalor to no discernible end Do you want to watch a couple bicker with his mom for ninety minutes Many scenes feature a shrieking baby The movie fails to elucidate why we would want to endure the mother from hell or why Jimmy Stewart cant grow a pair Who wanted to see this Who wanted to see Stewart and Lombard without laughs or charmIts absolutely depressing and unendurable,0
I recently started to watch this show in syndication and find it a bit hit and miss Some episodes are silly Doug is upset about some trivialjuvenile thing and acts stupid etcStill others are quite amusing and sometimes touching These include those episodes that face up to the complexities of the characters For instance the juvenile overweight amiable guy marries sexy wife theme is found in several sitcoms Carrie also has something about her lookswise Not just a run of the mill sexy girl But Carrie has an edge she might be nice on the eyes but has a few too many personality traits not too far different than her fatherAnd she readily admits to it for instance one episode revolves at her lack of desire to be nice to coworkers I personally find her bness sexy but you have to be the right sort of person to be able to live with that Amiable Doug is a good match And deep down see likes the simple things too Maybe not as much as Doug whose nirvana is watching TV and eating a big snack next to his big screen tv but no culture gal she This lack of an overally sensitive side is one reason the two dont have children Of course the simple pleasures of a guy is nothing to sneer at either and adds to the charm of the show They live an ordinary working class sort of life in Queens it is realistic in that sense And overall amusing and pleasant sitcom fare esp if you just want to relax It gets a little tired at the end so its probably good it is ending It had a good run See also Becker,1
Im sorry but even TJ Hookers Adrian Zmed couldnt save this sequel I went through half the movie thinking that this was a spoof of the original Then came that wild and wacky motorcycle scene notice that this is the only movie that Patricia Birch directs and I sadly realized they were trying to be serious I did get a kick out of the fact that the opposing gang having lost their wheels due to their gambling habits in the original Grease were forced to use motorcycles in the second movie Being shamed by that putz character Carrington Id hate to see what they would resort to later maybe MopedsI also never bought the hackneyed theme hunkyAustralianboycantfitintoOutsidersdominatedschoolergogoesfor toughguywithstupidbikerhelmetlook It was Disney story gone horribly awrySo it looks like you CAN ruin a good thing by placing a bubblegum smacking Michelle Pfeiffer in a musical The only thing I took away from this movie was an idea of how many points out of ten to give it,0
Man I remember this show with nostalgic I really dug Bravestarr because he wasnt the conventional hero He was more than a futuristic Texas cowboy The man had the strenght of a bear the vision of a walk and the agility of a I cant remember that oneThe action sequences were great I remember that Bravestarr would always use his bazooka named SARAJUANA translated to Spanish anytime he was in big troublesThis was a quality action cartoon I loved the characters the dialogs the music and of course the opening credits sequence Bravestarr long live to him A cult classic in my opinion and a must see,1
All credit to writerdirector Gilles Mimouni who fashioned this winding twisting tale of deceit and betrayal While keeping the utmost control he maintains the audience at arms length never allowing them to become completely aware of the goings on Even his clever denouement has you guessingThe three central performances are also top class with Vincent Cassel Romane Bohringer and Monica Bellucci doing their utmost to add to the mystery JeanPhillippe Ecoffey supplements strength in his supporting role To give away plot details or character specifics would not be fairThierry Arbogast uses the camera effectively to sweep us through this enigma and Cardine Biggerstaffs editing keeps the story a step ahead of us The theme from Peter Chase is sublime in its marriage to the ideal of the scriptMany may say Gilles Mimouni is trying to confront several deeper issues on the them of love For me this is simply a haunting elusive riddle that weaves a fascinating web Only the French are capable of such tantalisation Hollywood would have ruined this with a happy endingMonday March 2 1998 Hoyts CroydonNoone does thriller quite like the French When they get it right they really get it rightVincent Cassell is intriguing as the deceptive Max Romane Bohringer obsessive as the new Lisa and Monica Bellucci is mysterious as the first Lisa The plot from Gilles Mimouni is a whirlwind of deliberate deception and fatally crossed wiresAll credit must go to his manipulation of the clever plot and the performances from the three leads As Lucien JeanPhillippe Ecoffey is strong and emotionalFriday January 15 1999 Video,1
Youd think youre in for some serious sightseeing when the premise of the movie takes place primarily between two characters as they travel 3000 miles or so from France to Saudi Arabia going through most of Europe Italy Bulgaria Croatia Slovenia Turkey before arriving in the Middle East But this is not a tour and there are no stopovers for soaking in the sightsRedas father is in his twilight years and wishes to do the Haj However since walking and taking the mule is out of the question he chooses to travel to Mecca by car He cant drive and therefore enlists the help of Reda to his sons protest to get him there in their broken down vehicleBut Reda doesnt see the point of having him go along when his dad could opt for the plane He resents the idea of having put his personal life on hold for this pilgrimage he couldnt understand And hence we set off in this arduous journey with father and son being not the best of palsThe beauty of this movie is to witness the development of the father and son pair the challenges they face the weird people they meet having to duke it out in varied weather conditions and alternating rest stops between motels and sleeping in the car We see an obvious generation gap in them trying to communicate to each other the father trying to impose on his son and the son trying to assert himself as an adult but circumstances we see reveal that Reda is quite a fish out of water Through the many encounters they actually team up quite well despite their differencesIts perhaps quite apt to have this film released here last week to coincide with Hari Raya Haji and having the opportunity to watch our protagonists join the other pilgrims in their Haj The final scene in Mecca is truly a sight to behold and you too would feel the claustrophobia and fear as Reda tries to hunt down his dad amongst the thousands of people congregating The sights of Europe were perhaps deliberately not dwelled upon so as to build up the anticipation of and focus on the final destinationIt certainly rang home the thought of telling and showing loved ones how much you appreciate them for who they are Dont miss this and yes book early I was pleasantly surprised that this evenings session was still a full house,1
Every once in a while I will rent an actionadventure film just as a way to relax and occupy my mind with nothing important This is why I own a copy of Charlies Angels 2000 not a quality film but it makes me laugh and allows me to unwind for a while One of these days I will probably buy copies of The Princess Bride and a few Monty Python movies for much the same reasonIn any case I rented this film because I wanted to be entertained without being challenged For the most part I got what I wanted The plot was something along the lines of a poorly written Xena episode and the Kathy Longs acting was very community theater not bad for a professional kick boxer and amateur actress There were a few high points on the part of the cyborgs Somehow they managed to get some pretty good actors to play the bad guys unfortunately most of them die pretty darned quickLike most martial arts films the further you get into the movie the more emphasis there is on action and the plot which wasnt strong to begin with deteriorates almost as quickly as the acting However the more Kathy Long fights the more time the director devotes to her backside By the end of the movie I was seriously considering watching it a second time just to count the number of times Kathy Longs tight red shorts were center screenUnfortunately there just wasnt enough meat to this film to make satisfying curiosity worth seeing the film a second time If you are a hard core Xena fan in need of something to wile away a few hours by all means go to the grocery store and spend the 50 cents on the rental There are some strong similarities between the show and this movieJust dont expect anything more than to be mildly amused for a few hoursUnless of course you happen to like Kathy Longs derrire THEN you might want to purchase a copy,0
Read My Lips Sur mes lvres which probably has different idiomatic resonance in its French title is a nifty twisty contemporary tale of office politics that unexpectedly becomes a crime caper as the unusually matched characters slide up and down an ethical and sensual slippery slopeThe two leads are magnetic Emmanuelle Devos who Ive never seen before despite her lengthy resume in French movies and an even more disheveled than usual Vincent Cassel who has brought a sexy andor threatening look and voice to some US moviesThe first half of the movie is on her turf in a competitive real estate office and hes the neophyte The second half is on his turf as an excon and her wrenching adaptation to that milieuWriterdirector Jacques Audiard very cleverly uses the womans isolating hearing disability as an entre for us into her perceptions turning the sound up and down for us to hear as she does so its even more annoying than usual when audience members talk using visuals as sensory reactors as wellNone of the characters act as anticipated she is not like that pliable victim from In the Company of Men not in individual interactions not in scenes and not in the overall arc of the unpredictable story line well until the last shot but heck the audience was waiting for that fulfillment as we move from a hectic modern office to a hectic disco to romantic and criminal stakeouts There is a side story thats thematically redundant and unnecessary but that just gives us a few minutes to catch our breathsThis is one of my favorites of the year originally written 7282002,1
Irrespective of the accuracy of facts Bandit Queen is a true story its true because the themes it deals with hold as much truth today as they did way back in 1994 This movie is violent powerful and thought provokingThe protagonist is a woman of flesh and blood whose adversity brought out the bestor worst out of her Keeping the subjectivity aside there is no doubt that Phoolans character from a young girl of 8 who is married off by her father to clear a debtpun intended to a gang leader who goes on to become a leader of the lower caste has evolved into a champion in her own right Her portrayal is so powerful that the viewer is even willing to forgive her for a massacreI can understand if the western audience is not able to appreciate this masterpiece Bandit Queen needs to be studied in the Indian context and not just checked out in stereotypes I may not be able to sell it on its universal appeal but its certainly a must watch for the Indian audience its a shame that the movie had a delayed overtly censored release in IndiaBandit Queen is the story of a woman who fought against two odds in India being a woman and that too a lower caste her rebellious nature and inability to just give in caused her the most horrible experiences in life which only went on to strengthen her into a self proclaimed goddess She responded to violence with violence and dint become the submissive woman society wanted her to be Call it divine justice or judiciary failure had she killed a single person she would have been hanged she killed 24 and got revered respected and glorifiedPS Whoever found her character psychotic needs to be sodomized at 8 gangraped by 10 men at a go and paraded naked Then they should be asked How normal do they feel,1
How did Mike Hammer live in a penthouse with a GOLF BAG stashed in the corner next to a big screen cathode ray tube TV and a snazzy fireplace Nah hed knock back a bottle of rye and twenty unfiltered Camels on the couch or floor of his flyspecked office or in the stink of a lousy downtown LA flop house wiping the dried red crust and oil smeared mud off his face thats how Spillane wrote trash paperbacks for sure but how do you make it worse Give some desperate scheming producer a blank check because he thinks any Film Noir titled crap will sell at the box office add some overthehill hot tomatoes and just generally screwup the storyline by some retard drugged out screen writer thats how,0
Directed by E Elias Merhige Begotten is an experiment with a few interesting ideas that dont quite succeed in what they were trying to do The film is a 76 minute ultra slow questionably effective irritating experience that tries to present an intriguing philosophy about the creation of the Earth and human natureIt opens with god presented as a chairbound psychopathic man who tears open his stomach using a knife From the guts blood and human waste Mother Nature emerges She proceeds to impregnate herself with the dead gods semen Later she gives birth to the Son of the Earth A retard who is constantly abused a group of cannibalistic people whom I believe to be the representation of mankindBegotten takes a twisted and disturbing look on the origin of life Demonstrating the selfdestructive nature violence lust and greed that have become a trademark for mankind The problem in the movie come from two points One is that the film is just too slow in its exhibition What we get is a good thirty minutes spent on showing how the Son of the Earth is constantly shaking naked on the ground while at the same time being molested and tortured by mankind Such tasteless prolonging gets boring pretty fast and lacks the punch in delivering a blow to the viewers sensesAnother point is Beggotens visual appearance and sound The grainy inverted black and white low frame cinematography enchants the disturbing factor of the plot but such novelties often work in only short periods of time Then gradually begin to lose their effect as the audience becomes accustomed to the look The audio suffers from the same problems Its constant repetitive and similar sounds become annoying so fast I had an urge to turn off the volume Begotten loses its charm shortly after it begins It tries to be original and creative but it fails to expand on the ideas hinted by the vague plot instead it repeats the same scene again and againThe conclusion is that Begotten is stuck in one moment Even though plotwise it tries to move forward the visuals and audio remain the same throughout Showing the same action in a slightly different way with just slightly a different sound A gimmick cannot alone make a movie It also needs pace and variety something Merhige seems to have forgotten,0
I was impressed that I could take my 5 year old son to this movie without having to cover his ears or eyes No sex scenes no profanity and not even any violence Just good entertainment enjoyable from beginning to end Dennis Quaid pulls off this movie very well,1
This serial is interesting to watch as an MST3K feature but for todays audience thats all it is I was really surprised to see the year it was made as 1952 Considering that fact alone makes this a solid lowly 2 in my book The cars used dont even look contemporary they look like stuff from the 30s Its basically Cody the lone worlds salvation Sheesh talk about an insult to everyone else like the military anyway its Cody in his nipple ring flying suit against Graber and Daley two dumbss henchman who sport handguns and an occasional ray gun thats pretty lame in its own right enjoy If you want to watch a really good serial see Flash Gordan its full of rockets that attack each other and a good evil nemesis and also good looking women this has NONE of that And Flash was made 15 or so years before this crap so you can give it some slack Something made in 1952 this bad deserves a 2 Nuff said give it a 6 if your watching it as a MST3K episode those guys have some good fun with it a tweak of the nipples here a tweak there and Im flying And now as an added bonus I bring you the Commander Cody Theme song as originally sung by Joel and his two character bots Tom Servo and Crow aboard the satellite of love for episode eight The Enemy PlanetSinging at the very beginning creditsTOM SERVO SINGING YOUR WATCHING COMMANDER CODY HE IS THE NEW CHARACTER FROM REPUBLICHE GETS IN TROUBLE EVERY WEEK BUT HES SAVED BY EDITINGJUST A TWEAK OF HIS NIPPLES SENDS HIM ON HIS WAYA PUMPKIN HEAD AND A ROCKET PACK WILL SAVE THE DAYJOEL SINGING HIS LABRATORY IS A BOXING RING WHEN BAD GUYS COME TO MIX IT UPSOMEBODY ALWAYS GETS KIDNAPPED AND CODY HAS TO FIX IT UPHE DRINKS HIS TEA AT ALS CAFE AND FLIES ALONG ON WIRESHE BEATS THE CROOKS AND FLIES WITH HOOKS AND PUTS OUT FOREST FIRESCROW SINGINGBAD GUYS BEWARE CODY IS THEREYOULL LIKE HIS HAIR ITS UNDER HIS HELMUT AND BECAUSE WE CANT THINK OF A GOOD RHYMETHATS THE END OF THE COMMANDER CODY THEME SONG SO SIT RIGHT BACK WITH A WILL OF GRANITEAND WATCH CHAPTER EIGHT CAUSE THATS THE ENEMY PLANET,0
Just finished watching this one after getting sick of getting ready for the Michigan Bar Exam I wanted something that was mindless and that I could just sit back and say what the hell were they thinking I was not disappointed in this undertaking but had I been watching this one in a serious mood I would have been irate The company that made this thing just spliced CGI footage from the first Octopus and added a little footage with a fake octopus that makes the one used in Bride of the Monster look like a masterpiece of special effect footage Since when does an octopus have fangs The plot is that an NYPD diver is investigating some murdersdisappearances on the Hudson River shortly before the Fourth of July He and his partner who is soon to be transferred or soon to be munched on by a fig bucking octopus investigate in a rather inept manner all the while believing that a huge octopus will kill people and are occasionally accompanied by a female lackey from the Mayors office Of course on one believes that an octopus can get that big until the thing attacks the cop and the girl from the mayors office Surprisingly all hell doesnt break loose and only a few cops and a few more civilians are killedReally lame Dont bother with it,0
Evil warlord puts a town through pain and suffering Not long before they call upon giant stone samurai Daimaijin for help Daimaijin soon comes and really gets the warlord with all his viscious might The revenge climax is really funny as Daimajin squashes guys under his feet and crushes guys with his fist and even drives a spike though a mans heart,1
Solo starts as a team of US soldiers go into Soth America to blow up a rebel airstrip joining them is a robot named Solo Mario Van Peebles who can use any weapon ever made is fifteen times stronger ten times faster than any human being Something goes wrong though Solo refuses to kill innocent civilians which Colonel Frank Madden William Sadler isnt happy about back at base General Haynes Barry Corbin orders Solo to be shut down reprogrammed One of Solos main directives is self preservation so decides to escape back into the South American jungles where Colonel Madden his men are sent in to recapture itThis Mexican American coproduction was directed by Norberto Barba one has to say Solo is awful The script by David Corley was based on the novel Weapon by Robert Mason is one clich after another robots were popular at the time Solo was made in Hollywood at the boxoffice so Solo ripoffs the likes of Robocop 1987 Universal Soldier 1992 the two Terminator flicks as well as having the same setting basic story as Predator 1987 This is the usual rubbish about an emotionless robot who grows a sense of humanity while being around people at first he doesnt know what a joke is or why one person would care for another but by the end he develops emotions starts to befriend people sounds like Terminator 2 Judgment Day 1991 to me The characters are poor Colonel Madden in particular is given absolutely no motivation for hating Solo at all why he would kill other US soldiers disobey orders to destroy it You know I saw this on cable telly last night for free thank god I didnt spend any money on it I looked it up in the TV guide do you know what it said My TV guide described Solo as a dire scifi action starring Mario Van Peebels which when I think about it is a perfect description of Solo In less than ten words my TV guide has hit the nail on the head I mean its a scifi action film it certainly stars Mario Van Peebles its definitely dire Enough said reallyDirector Barba doesnt do anything particularly special here the action scenes lack any real excitement the scifi elements are virtually none existent apart from the fact Solo is a robot So the military lose Solo Colonel Madden is sent in to recapture it right Im not being funny but wouldnt the military have put a self destruct mechanism inside Solo in case something like that happened Surely at the very least Solo would have had a tracking device inside it so the military would at least know where it was at any given time Im not being funny but these people can come up with a walking talking robotic soldier but they are not clever enough to realise that a tracking or self destruct device might be useful if anything went wrong The violence is mild there are a few OK fight scenes but this is pretty weak stuff reallyTechnically the film looks alright is competently made it was actually shot in Mexico The makers of the Dolph Lundgren action flick Agent Red 2000 edited footage from Solo into that film The acting is poor Van Peebles was the perfect choice to play an emotionless robot William Sadler deserves better than this it was only a few years prior he was staring in the fantastic Die Hard 2 Die Harder 1990Solo is a really bad scifi action flick which is basically a huge ripoff of big budget Hollywood scifi action films like Robocop Universal Soldier the Terminator films Not recommend Im going to start pay more attention to my TV guide when it comes to choosing films to watch,0
I dont care what anyone else says this movie is the worst piece of trash committed on film What was John Landis thinkingI know its based on a series of childrens books but cmon Even kids hate this movie Its pointless and boring Tom Arnold once again amply demonstrates that his only talent is wasting production moneyI think the only reason The Stupids hasnt appeared on the 100 worst films of all time is that only 20 or so people will admit to watching this garbage At least Hobgoblins made it on MST3K,0
Based on an actual story John Boorman shows the struggle of an American doctor whose husband and son were murdered and she was continually plagued with her loss A holiday to Burma with her sister seemed like a good idea to get away from it all but when her passport was stolen in Rangoon she could not leave the country with her sister and was forced to stay back until she could get ID papers from the American embassy To fill in a day before she could fly out she took a trip into the countryside with a tour guide I tried finding something in those stone statues but nothing stirred in me I was stone myself Suddenly all hell broke loose and she was caught in a political revolt Just when it looked like she had escaped and safely boarded a train she saw her tour guide get beaten and shot In a split second she decided to jump from the moving train and try to rescue him with no thought of herself Continually her life was in danger Here is a woman who demonstrated spontaneous selfless charity risking her life to save another Patricia Arquette is beautiful and not just to look at she has a beautiful heart This is an unforgettable story We are taught that suffering is the one promise that life always keeps,1
This movie had very few moments of real drama After the opening minutes the film descended in a spiral that didnt quite take us to hell and back viewing was pure purgatory to say the least The acting was more horrendous than the subject matter of the film and at times I couldnt stop laughing The continuity between some of the scenes was dire characters disappeared from scenes without explanation only to be replaced by other characters who minutes earlier had been some where else Surely this was a spoof of The Exorcist The collection plate at the church must have been full of copper the day Mr Russo signed up for this one Do I speak Latin Et tu Brutus,0
Before I start to tear apart this movie mark youI LOVE THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL That story is one of the best romantic adventures ever written The movie staring Jane Grey is very good and the musical on Broadway is the hottest thing there So I thought when I heard that this film was coming out that it would be great since it was a BBC filmTo my surprise it was a weak totally stupid story that UTTERLY failed in capturing the gorgeous taleThere were no exciting escapes with daring disguises There was no deep love that made your heart flutter as Percy left the room and Marguerite sighed as her husband was leaving her againAll it had was a confusing plot and a lot of outoftheblue sex and violenceSink me What a horrible movie,0
This movie is a bad memory from my childhood This is one of those movies that they show kids on a rainy day at school when you cant go out for recess and youd rather be watching anything ANYTHING else At least thats what it was like when I was in elementary school I just remember HATING this movie Granted I havent seen it in 15 years or so and they probably dont use it on rainy days anymore but I just want to warn everyone Youd be better off using this to put your kids to sleep than entertaining them Trust me pick anything else Even though the topic is kind of controversial the plot is so tame and slow that I cant remember anything about it except that I disliked it so strongly that here 15 years later I felt the need to warn all of you against it,0
I wish I could laugh again as much as when I saw this show for the first time I have not done so ever sinceThe strange thing is I find myself laughing almost as hard after watching the show again and again Eddie Izzard is cultivated is poignant is a man of the world He is deft talking about politics and yet feels no need to engage in political discussion He is above that I would contrast him to George Carlin who uses his comedy to try and convince people about his ideas and does not seem to enjoy the fact that he is trying to entertainFunniest guy on Earth,1
Though Stephen Gyllenhaal is a good TV director with a few good fulllength to his credit Homegrown is just a mess in its script and direction Despite performances from Billy Bob Thorton John Lithgow Kelly Lynch Jon Bon Jovi Jamie Lee Curtis and Ted Danson a cast this good couldnt save the filmGyllenhaalics will know that Jake and Maggie are in the film but you dont see Jake very well and Maggies only in it for 30 seconds as babysitter tipping off Lithgows character about a bust Its not even a lowbrow pot comedy as the film was intended to be It just wasnt funny,0
Although too young to remember the first showing of the series being just a baby I later caught repeats of it on television in the late 80s just when I was getting interested in the war and all of its aspects It was my grandfather who first showed me the series and also gave me my first interests relating tales of his time in the Royal Navy at Malta and later in the Pacific Since then I have devoured many books and seen many television series about the World War Two era with mixed opinions The British television stations are generally very good at producing these as The World At War can easily attest with many gems made by both the BBC and independent companies I strongly recommend such titles as The Nazis A warning From History Blitz and the BBC series about Dunkirk Britain At War In Colour with its companion series Japan Germany and America are of a very high standard The World At War is by far the best and despite its age never fails to deliver There will always be new revelations about the war that will keep cropping up that obviously arent included in the series and of course World War Two took place over such a large canvas that to produce a series with EVERY detail would take more time and money then any other even if such an undertaking was even possible What I feel I must say to those who decry that it does not include everything is that The World At War cant physically do that as a series but it sure as heck can prompt you to do further research and make it enjoyable That certainly worked for me I now have a very comprehensive library of books videos DVDs and tapes and CDs Recommend to anyone with even a passing interest The series was so well made that theyd find it hard not to agree that it is quality programming and highly informative,1
This film is a lyrical and romantic memoir told through the eyes an eleven year old boy living in a rural Cuban town the year of the Castro revolution It is an obviously genuine worthy labor of love The names CUBA LIBRE and CUBAN BLOOD are merely attempts to wrongly market this as an action film DREAMING OF JULIA makes much more sense It has more in common with European cinema than with RAMBO and the revolution is merely an inconvenience to peoples daily lives and pursuits That fact alone makes the film more honest than most works dealing with this time period in Cuban historyThe excessive use of the voiceover narrator does undermine the story but the film makes up for it with unqualified clips from Hollywood films that say so much more visually than the narrator couldThe comparisons to CINEMA PARADISO and are fair game as the film does wax melancholy about movies but there is an underlying pain at the loss of a lifestyle that surpasses lost love The revolution like the film JULIE never seems to have an ending,1
This is not Michael Madsens fault he was hardly in it This movie was just awful If you want to laugh and be bored go ahead and watch this movie Words cannot describe how idiotic it is Sorry Michael The cinematography was dark All the other actors are unknowns When watching it it feels like a soft porn but with no nudity or heated scenes This movie had sexual overtones since it is about a underground S M killer The acting was bad except Michael Madsens parts He looked like he wanted to laugh I hope he got paid well for this lousy movie It is something I would not be proud of It is not even a B movie for cable it is more like a F and it should never be shown ever,0
No real plot no character development no Scorceselevel direction but seriously were you really expecting any of this The only thing that matters is that this flick is absolutely hilarious nearly on the same level as Borat Sure the ending drags a bit but if Borats cameo didnt crack you up you must be the worst batty boy in the history of batty boys Sacha Baron Cohen is possibly the greatest comedian ALIVE and here he gets more laughs than Jude Law on a nude beach I dare you not to laughIf you can pull the tenfoot pole out of your behind for an hour and a half and just enjoy some well timed and extremely stupid jokes in a stupid story about a stupid character see this stupid movie Youll be glad you did Keep it real,1
This movie is worse than heavens gate or plan 9 from outer space Dont know why it got even one Oscar it should have gotten a million raspberries just like the audiences that either walked out or didnt show up in the first place The Hospital was a firstrate financial failure but Im certain the elite classes of leftwing guttermouthed intellectuals railed that the American public was far too plebeian to appreciate biting socialcommentary when they saw it and on and on George C Scott in one of mostartless and embarrassing roles along with aging sexsymbol Diana Rigg spend most of the movie trying to cuss in an increasinglyblas manner as they push along a silly plot Poor old George is impotent and is just crushed by the event but after lots of dirty language between him and Rigg he rapes her multiple times on lovely night in a filthy crumbling NYC hospital that looks so disgusting that I wouldnt want a dying pet rat treated in it Theres also some sacrilegious junkdialog tossed about hither and yon laced with plenty of cussing as well It ends by portraying the faulty notion that unusual stress without physical exertion always brings on cardiac arrest Never want to see another minute of this awful movie again,0
hi This is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life The day when I watched this movie I was having high fever But still I watched the movie with lots of patience And after watching the movie I felt like repenting Because I wasted 3 hrs for this stupid movie I could have taken rest rather then watching this movie And I was really surprised that how come actors like Sunny Deol Akshay Kumar Aftab etc acted in this movieI dont understand if directors dont find a good story to make a film then why do they remain as directors Why cant they sit at home and spent their time at home I request to all directors that it will be good for them if they request audiences either by mail or by media newspapers radios etc to send them a nice story if they dont find any good story for to make a film I request again to all directors please dont make such films,0
Here we have 2 misunderstood kids who never stood a chance against a cruel poverty riddled existence Robin Hoods singled out by the police for persecution because they were a trifle wild at times Gad According to this crap Bonnie was the sweetest little thing west of the Missouri who was taught to be a psychopathic murderer by a fun loving boyfriend who didnt really want to hurt anybodyhe just wanted things without putting a lot of energy into getting them Badly acted poorly filmed unbelievable dialogue unrealistic use of weaponry gore that looked more like grape jelly than the real thing Avoid this bilgewater Thumbs down 5 stars,0
I have waited a long time for someone to film a faithful version of HG Wells classic novel War Of The Worlds Timothy Hines has finally done it I just couldnt believe how good it was From the acting to the costuming the outofthis world special effects I just cant say enoughIt was wonderful Dramatic intense full of firstrate performances by a topnotch cast Its got to be seen to be believed I sure didnt And Ive read all those negative comments by the others and cant believe what they were saying We mustve been watching a different movie huh And those real bad comments by that vepsaian guy guy whoever he is well he just doesnt know what hes talking aboutKeep up the good work mr Hines,1
I thought the movie was subpar The acting was good but not great the story was funny but did not come out that way The director dropped the ball on this movie It was not James jim or Tea IMHO it was the music that killed it There is a scene where things go down hill and Jonny Cash music is playing man was that depressing not funny killed my mood After that the movie could not recover The deportation scene had potential funny situation good acting good set up I even smirked but the music again was unsuited to the scene The music kept me from being pulled in to the movieI say it had potential but was poorly done i would even say rushed into final production Kind of reminiscent of the prequel to the exorcist the beginning The theater release was good I though so after watching it but the movie release exorcistdominion was a helluva lot better Same story just different director Same should be done here,0
This was just another marvelous film of the Berlin Festival But unlike Yes by Sally Potter which I had seen some days before where after leaving the cinema I felt a strong desire of wishing to embrace the whole world and was just happy to be alive this time quite the opposite thing happened there was something that dragged me down and the air suddenly felt cold and hard to breathe It was as if all of a sudden there was nothing left all hope all future had been taken away to a dead placeNinas life seemed to be dismal and locked but then one lovely day there appears that kind of luminosity that opens up the horizon and makes her believe in the fulfillment of her dreams There was nobody at her side but suddenly she finds a companion just out of nothing someone who was able to share the most hidden feelings of her life That person was Toni a vagabond girl who does not seem to have any roots just like herselfBut the films title is Ghosts and ghosts appear and disappear as they wish there is no way to retain them Ghosts also represent the hidden fantasies of people strange ideas that occupy your mind and are only perceived by yourself hiding away from all other people Franoise a French woman is a victim of such ghosts She once lost her child daughter in Berlin who apparently had been robbed from her in a supermarket in just one moment of inattentiveness Now time has passed and Franoise is back in Berlin still looking for the missing childNina could be that child after all she has got that same scar at her ankle and the heartshaped birthmark between her shoulder blades which seems to prove her true identityAnd Nina adopts that idea after all she is not only in desperate need of a companion she also longs for a mother But in the end she is emptyhanded Toni has disappeared with a man and her supposed mum turns out to be a sick woman Marie is dead concludes Franoises husband and the statement could not be more disillusioning Nina is just a nia a girl without name there is no hope for any divine fulfillment There is no Marie in this world to accompany our lonely lives Therefore in the end we see Nina all alone about to walk along the road that has opened up before her into a future that seems joyless and uncertain,1
Frownland is like one of those intensely embarrassing situations where you end up laughing out loud at exactly the wrong time and just at the moment you realize you shouldnt be laughing youve already reached the pinnacle of voice resoundness and as you look around you at the ghostly white faces with their gaping wideopen mouths and glazen eyes you feel a piercing ache beginning in the pit of your stomach and suddenly rushing up your throat and well you get the pointBut for all its unpleasantness and punches in the face Frownland really is a remarkable piece of work that after viewing the inarticulate mess of a main character and all his pathetic troubles and mishaps makes you want to scratch your own eyes out and at the same time you feel sickenly sorry for himIt would have been a lot easier for me to simply walk out of Ronald Bronsteins film but for some insane reason I felt an unwavering determination to stay the course and experience all the grainy irritation the film has to offer If someone sets you on fire you typically want to put it out Stop Drop And Roll But with this film you want to watch the flame slowly engulf your entire body You endure the painperhaps out of spite or some unknown masochistic curiosity I cant even begin to attempt to explainUnfortunately mainstream cinema will never let this film come to a theater near you But if you get a chance to catch it prepare yourself bring a doggie bag,1
I am really surprised that this movie get a ranking like this I havent seen such a bad movie for yearsOmg this was a really bad movie Splatter is not enough to describe the unnecessary nearly funny blood scenes If you didnt like hostel2 or Wolf Creek or Halloween 2007 well this is 10 time worse The story remind me RL Stine goosebumpsI cant tell about the acting since the script was so terribleClich all the time why i must write 10lines i never understood thisHere comes spoilersThe story is about a butcher killing people all the time in metro We are talking about thousands of killings and no one gets notice Actually those people are just missing And There is the good guy that tries to solve the mystery well there is no mystery for us because we know from the beginning the bad guy and as usual no one believes him what a surprise In the end he puts butcher clothes and fights to death with the killer butcher,0
The Italian concept of sprezzatura was the grace and nonchalance in social manners that led to success in love as described in the 16th century manual The Courtier The film Hitch is worth watching for the embodiment of the sprezzzatura concept in the dynamic performance of Will SmithSmith plays the character of Alex Hitch Hitchens who is a professional dating consultant to those short on luck and confidence The best scenes are when Hitch coaches the painfully shy and maladroit Albert in his quest to win the heart of a New York socialite and in Hitchs own attraction to Sara and a surprise for her when visiting Ellis Island In these scenes Smith is supported with good work from Kevin James and Eva Mendes But this film is driven by the charm and winsome personality of SmithFrom start to finish Smith rises above the average comic script to make Hitch an eminently watchable and entertaining film I do not believe there is another actor working today who is capable of delivering the charisma and the perfect timing with the comic moments like Will Smith in this film And his secret is in the sprezzatura,1
Bon Voyage is fun for the audience because it combines the requisite silliness of a comedy with just enough sobriety to keep viewers actively engaged and invested in the outcome Most importantly though the film is also historically instructive it captures the tension of the socalled phony war and later the French aristocracys flight from Paris ahead of the German onslaught Yet Bon Voyage is not a war movie It is a comedy about the lives of a handful of people set against the backdrop of extraordinary times Bon Voyage conveys the chaos confusion and emotional bewilderment of a nation of the brink of collapse and the wide spectrum of French reactions to the new political order This film is a comedy which entertains the audience a romance which skillfully utilizes many clichs and a story of a handful of people whose nation is collapsing around them,1
If you like horror movies with lots of blood and gore tons of jumpscare moments and unrelenting escalating scenes of excruciating death then look elsewhere If you like quiet moody thoughtful horror which casts blood aside in favor of a genuine feeling of dread then Wendigo is for youThoughtful stressed out George his psychoanalyst wife Kim and their young son Miles are heading out to the snowy countryside for a long weekend vacation away from the city On the way up George hits a stag with his car The hunters who had been pursuing the deer are not thrilled when they find that George has ended their chase In particular deranged hunter Otis takes it personally He follows the family to their vacation home making sure they see him He spies on George and Kim as they have sex He fires through their windows with his rifle when they arent home letting them discover the ominous holes in their windows and walls when they return When Kim takes Miles to the drugstore in town Miles is attracted to a small sculpture in a display case carved to resemble a man with the head of a stag A Native American man tells Miles that this is the Wendigo a spirit of the woods who has a taste for flesh and is always hungry Miles takes the figure home with him already haunted by the death of the deer the day before That afternoon when he and his father go sledding George is shot and Miles pursued through the woods by a creature barely glimpsedor is he just in shock and imagining the whole thing Hours later George is rushed to the hospital and Miles still clutching his statue either faints dreams or goes on a vision quest in which the Wendigo returns This time the angry flesh eating god part tree part stag and part man is hunting for Otis who has finally gone over the edgeWendigo is a beautifully made film almost totally silent but for the wind howling through the snow covered trees Okay so the monster itself is kind of fakeylooking but its a small flaw more than made up for by the genuine feeling of tension and dread that creeps through every frame of the film and the eerie backdrop of the silent snowy countryside The performances are great particularly by Jake Weber as the moody and thoughtful George and Patricia Clarkson as his sweet but nononsense wife They are a happy couple with their share of common problems and it is the strength of their relationship and their love for each other that makes this film powerful Watching this film is often like watching someones home videos so realistic are the performances This movie is not for everyone A lot of people may find themselves totally bored waiting for the hideous Lovecraftian Beast and bloody revenge that never come We can never really be sure if the Wendigo even exists seen as it is through the eyes of a sensitive child and also later through the eyes of a madman This is more a psychological drama than a horror film but it has more than enough creepy elements in it to satisfy fans of subtle horror,1
Fairly funny Jim Carrey vehicle that has him as a News reporter who temporarily gets the power of God and wrecks havoc Carrey is back in familiar ground here and looks to be having a good time and Jennifer Aniston as his put upon girlfriend is also charming and affecting The story is predictible to the extreme but the cast including Morgan Freeman as God is great and makes the film worth catching GRADE B,1
I first saw this in the 70s on syndicated TV and admired its production values which were high tech for the time The remastered video is rich and colorful far more intense then the pale 35 mm TV prints This movie deserves more attention it paved the way for UFO Space 1999 and even Star Wars with its detailed miniatures and cleverly conceived gadgets Sure the story of an alternative antimatter planet Earth has been recycled a hundred times since Star Trek but the beauty of this film is its selfconscious European flair for design from the Rolls Royce space engines to the Euro Sec letterhead business paper JFSS or Dopplegangers as it was called in Europe is enjoyable for the imaginary vision of Europe in space in the shadow of the Superpowers Gerry and Sylvia Andersons ambitious epic gets a little tedious when the American astronaut finally realizes that he is on the doppleganger Earth and everything is literally downhill after the poetically graceful shuttle boarding sequence A mediocre story is helped along by a grand and lyrical classical score by the late great Barry Gray the John Williams of Britain,1
Saving Grace is a feel good movie with its heart in the right place Grace is recently widowed and realizes her late husband left her with a lot of debts She could lose her lovely house and sees no other solution to her misery than to start growing marijuana Shes living in a beautiful village where most viewers would love to live and the villagers are all wonderful people most viewers would love to have as neighbors Theres only one thing wrong with this picture and that is the way it portraits the effect marijuana has on its user Its obvious none of the actors or writers of this film actually ever did smoke the stuff The way the villagers act after smoking a joint is ridiculous and only supposedly funny Its precisely in those scenes that wit is replaced by English slapstick and that is a pity in a movie that is none the less very enjoyable,1
I dont think anyone besides Terrence Malick and maybe Tran Anh Hung makes cinema on a purer level than Claire Denis That said I dont love this her newest film quite as much as her 2001 masterpiece Trouble Every Day although it comes very close which itself is one of my absolute favorite films It it only because the narrative here is possibly slightly too elliptical for its own good Dont get me wrong the fact that this film barely has a plot at all is really one of the best things about it but I think Denis took it about one degree farther than it needed to go and consequently the film does flirt with incomprehensibility and a few key plot points should have been clarified somehow like that the main character goes to South Korea to get his heart transplant instead of just showing him there all of a sudden without any explanation of where he is or why he is there Also some of the other characters seemed unnecessary and as if they were just excuses for Denis to use actors she likes yet again Beatrice Dalles character in particular is a little distracting because you keep expecting that she is going to have some significance Still the film is incredibly absorbing and the cinematography is beyond amazing It is definitely very much a masterpiece in its own way At least as good as Denis more highlyacclaimed Beau travail if not better Claire Denis has to be my favorite French director at this point better than Leos Carax even Also I have to admit that the South Korean sequence really does do Lost in Translation better than that film itself does and I unlike some am a huge fan of that film as well,1
After a somewhat slow start I thought this movie about the Italian occupation of a Greek island during World War II picked up and became a quite enjoyable watch for a couple of hours from primarily two points of view The love triangle is an interesting one and strikes me as believable because I know it happened in various places under occupation Penelope Cruz played Pelagia a young Greek girl engaged to be married to Mandras Christian Bale I had questions about the depth of their love from the start but their future was torn apart when Italy invaded Greece and Mandras went off to fight After German intervention Greece is conquered and the island Pelagia lives on comes under Italian occupation during which Pelagia meets and begins to fall in love with Captain Corelli Nicholas Cage This of course was a dilemma that came to many young women in occupied lands As they got to know their occupiers they started to see them not as the enemy but as real people and sometimes fell in love often to the disapproval of their neighbours I just finished reading an interesting book about the German occupation of Britains Channel Islands in which this was a major issue Once Mandras returns to the island Pelagia is torn between themThe second background issue is the Italian occupation itself which I thought was quite realistically portrayed First was the contempt with which the island treated their Italian occupiers Greece defeated Italy quite true from a historical perspective and was really conquered by the Germans The refusal of the town to surrender to the Italians and instead to insist on surrendering to a German officer struck me as something that could well have happened and was quite funny in fact I loved the line we would rather surrender to this Germans dog than to you Italians The portrayal of the Italian troops also struck me as believable The Italian Army was never enamoured of their German ally and never enthusiastic about fighting with them Although Hitler and Mussolini were close friends their soldiers tended to treat each other with contempt Here the Italians are more interested in singing than fighting which the German troops on the island simply cant understand and are ecstatic when Italy makes peace and withdraws from the war until they discover that this may well make them prisoners of the Germans It was all quite well done I thoughtIt falters a bit at the end with an all too predictable finish but still deserves praise710,1
I dont know who financed it or why but this want to be vampire flick is really awful It tries to be hip and appeal to the young MTVgeneration audience but it is just downright laughable The acting is horrible and the directing is horrendous I heard the budget was 600000 I want to know where all the money went,0
An utterly beautiful film one of a handful of I saw when young that entranced me then and still do in Thiefs case the impression actually seems to get better with the passing of time By the 90s my daughter and I had seen it many times on TV but still went to the pictures when it came to the local arthouse cinema when it had finished we came out starry eyed with heads full of poetry and Miklos Rozsas stirring music wishing it could have lasted a couple of hours longer and thinking what a beautiful world it suddenly was againIdealistic Prince Ahmad wants to slum it amongst his people for a while to check things out but evil Vizier Jaffar takes his chance to imprison him and seize the throne After escaping with a little thief played by Sabu Ahmad spots a Princess and they fall blindingly in love along the way they have many adventures although apparently not enough for Sabu and Love not only conquers but annihilates everything The special effects must have been mesmerising in 1940 but Time has taken its toll and lessened their impact especially since digital cartoonery has taken over even live action but they still hold up well compared against films like Superman from 40 years later Anyway if Im requested to suspend disbelief in gargantuan guffawing genies flying horses and carpets I also suspend disbelief in perfect special effects Favourite bits the dreamy scene in the sunlit garden when Ahmad reveals himself and Adelaide Halls suitably romantic song the stunning colours in the tent in the Land Of Legend in fact the stunning colours throughout Sabu and Rozsas triumphant but still wistful finale Conrad Veidt played the baddie in two of the most incredible movie romances ever this and Casablanca and then died John Justin and June Duprez were great in the leading roles of lovers both of them slightly and refreshingly stilted but the parts didnt call for a huge range of emotions only pure love matteredTheres a couple of mildly violent images in it but rest assured this is a glorious feelgood experience with a 100 positive message its only a pity that nowadays little kids dont watch this instead of the porn they prefer One of my Top 10 film favourites I cant recommend this too much may it be shown to the end of Time,1
When you see the cover of the DVD youre convinced this is some Class B cheesy cheapie a film made for 1000 in somebodys backyardWrong This is quality material and really good Its a comedy and a clever one at that It also is very touching in spots with a nice spot of kindness The production values are very good this looks excellent the actors are known the films direction and sets are great Its amazing Who would have thoughtCarrieAnn Moss playing againsttype is terrific asHelen Robinson the June Cleaverlike wife Billy Connolly is great as the grunting goodhearted zombie Fido Tim Blake Nelson Mr Theopolis is a hoot is the neighbor with the sexy zombie girlfriend Tammy and Henry Czerny and Dylan Baker as dads check are excellent too KSun Ray as young Timmy Robinson shouldnt be overlooked either In fact he probably has more lines in the movie than anyoneIf I explain the story it will sound so stupid that few of you would watch it Youll just have to take the word of the people here who liked it and found it to be a very very pleasant surprise You need a dark sense of humor though an appreciation of the absurd,1
The film Cross Eyed by Adam Jones propels the viewer on a ride of redemption as the main character takes back control of the wheel and sets his life in order Adam Jones has found an imaginative and refreshing way to empower his character and actualize what matters most These truths become apparent to both the characters and viewers as you laugh and gag to the credits with them The simple yet attractive settingscostumes keep you guessing about what you will see next You cant help but smile and laugh at the antics that take place in this movie I cant wait for his sophomore effort It is only a matter of time before Jones strikes again Bravo,1
MANNA FROM HEAVEN is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time You know that the characters after finding out that the socalled Gift From God was actually a loan will pay back the money and that everyone will be happy at the end but how they get there is not as obvious The scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going The cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip Frank Gorshin Shirley Jones and Cloris Leachman prove that they are capable of more than playing the Riddler Mother Partridge or Marys friend Phyllis while Jill Eikenberry and Wendie Malick play characters different than we have seen on their TV series Ursula Burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church If you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a Shirley Jones rendition of The Way You Look Tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try I dont think you will be disappointed,1
An amazing piece of film that was wellconceived and kept me on the edge of my seat Brilliantly orchestrated in its timing and the comedy kicked in exactly when the tension needed a release The acting was generally welldone the Director shouldve asked Alec Guinness for acting lessons and the shot selections were impressive as in elongating the hall as Billy tries to race to the door in the studio This movie didnt let up since the opening scene,1
While not truly terrible this movie is still largely a waste of time and paints an incredibly inaccurate and revisionist picture of Beach Boys historyBasically this movie would have you believe that Mike Love was the brains behind the band and Brian Wilson was just a pathetic psycho In fact none of the characters is developed beyond a onedimensional parody but this is a TV movie so what do you expect Mike Loves foul stench is all over this turkey as he attempts to rewrite history with himself in the role of band figurehead and resident genius Yeah as ifOn the plus side the music is excellent Unlike the previous Beach Boys madeforTV biopic Summer Dreams this movie actually features real Beach Boys music rather than anemic cover versionsAlso it features a surprising number of Beach Boysrelated rarities and seldomheard tracks The Sunrays I Live for the Sun being but one exampleThis movie was originally shown in two parts on American network TV Part one is the superior of the two and documents the Boys early days and rise to the top By the time part two rolls around the Brian Wilson character has become a mere cartoon and the actor seems to be playing for laughs but how could anyone take this crap seriously If youre not a Beach Boys fan you probably wont get much out of this movie except an extremely warped and onesided view of the bands history But then again why would you watch this if you werent a fan,0
Try not to see this one I thought it was going to be good because Im a fan of cheesy 80s films and Ive enjoyed quite a bit of Linnea Quigleys work I was wrong I should have said no and watched Gigli instead which is probably a far better film I guess my biggest problem with this film was its attempt at humor Nothing about it was funny or even close to funny The acting is bad even for the queen of cheesy 80s films There is no story just random clips I guess I shouldnt hate it so much because it was just made as a fun and silly piece but I didnt have any fun and I wasnt entertained once I even had to fast forward to the ending to get through all of the crap Im sorry but I dont find zombies doing aerobics funny,0
I just dont see how a ConcordeNew Horizons film directed by Jim Wynorski and featuring the acting talents of Andrew Stevens and a puppet could be bad It just boggles the mind doesnt itWell lets make no mistake about it Munchie Strikes Back is indeed a bad film Munchie is a puppet who has been around for many centuries For reasons not fully explained until the end of the film he is sent to Earth to help a single mother and her son The moms problem her main problem at least is that she has a balloon payment due on her mortgage in two weeksto the notsotiny tune of 20000 Ouch She cant come up with the money because she just got fired OKJUST is the key word in that sentence What the Was she planning on paying it off with a single paycheck Maybe it wouldve been a good idea to have spent the last several years saving up for itya thinkMunchie has magical powers similar to those a genie would possessbut there isnt a limit on the number of wishes you can make Munchie gets the boy a bunch of fancy stuff for one night but then the kid asks for it to be sent back to the mall Munchie was borrowing it from The annoying furball also uses his otherworldly skills to help the boy win a baseball game by means of cheating A baseball is hit so hard that it orbits the Earth several times Sadly those dumb parents watching the game dont think its at all strange HmmAnyway Id like to wrap this up because this has already drained away enough of my lifeforce as it is Youll be truly moved by the scene where LeslieAnne Down playing the mother kicks a dog which is yapping at her Your heart will melt at her charm when she notices dollar bills fluttering down on her front yard and she wonders how it could be snowing during the summer Munchie Strikes Backs credits promised another film to follow entitled I believe Munchie Hangs Ten To date the movie viewing public has been robbed of what would surely have been a cinematic tour de force Heh 110,0
I find it hard to believe this could happen at all We do not know if Justin and Richard were troubled or had committed crimes in the past The movie seems to imply that they were not in and out of trouble So the first crime they commit is murder Just to play and jostle with the cops How do they pick up any girl and just say you are it Also Richard seems to strangle the woman with little or no effort nor does the women seem to struggle Hmmm This whole concept is really hard to believe That said lets move on I found myself really hating these punks and would love to have been present with my shot gun with police tactical ammo and see what their plastic suits do then As for Cassie who was a victim of Carl Hudson has a horrible time trying to survive The memory of having been stabbed 17 times by Carl leaves her in an emotional mess Sandra does a superb acting job She sure made me believe she was one angry cop As for solving the crime I thought it was great This movie kept me planted in my chair Loved the acting of all but Sam He had no getup and go The one thing this movie did not need was the love scene or should I say the rape scene,1
This clever film was originally a Japanese film And while I assume that original film was pretty bad it was made a good bit worse when AmericanInternational Films hacked the film to pieces and inserted Americanmade segments to fool the audience Now unless your audience is made of total idiots it becomes painfully obvious that this was doneand done with little finesse or care about the final product The bottom line is that you have a lot of clearly Japanese scenes and then clearly American scenes where the film looks quite different Plus the American scenes really are meaningless and consist of two different groups of people at meetings just talking about Gamerathe evil flying turtle And although this is a firebreathing flying and destructive monster there is practically no energy because I assume the actors were just embarrassed by being in this wretched filmin particular film veterans Brian Donlevy and Albert Dekker They both just looked tired and illatease for being thereNow as for the monster its not quite the standard Godzillalike creature Seeing a giant fanged turtle retract his head and limbs and begin spinning through the air like a missile is hilarious On the other hand the crappy model planes destructible balsa buildings and power plant are as usual in this film and come as no surprise Plus an odd Japanese monster movie clich is included that will frankly annoy most nonJapanese audience members and that is the adorable and precocious little boy who loves the monster and believes in him Yeah right Well just like in GODZILLA VERSUS THE SMOG MONSTER and several other films youve got this annoying creep cheering on the monster though unlike later incarnations of Godzilla Gamera is NOT a good guy and it turns out in the end the kid is just an idiot Silly exceptional poor special effects that could be done better by the average seven yearold bad acting meaningless American clips and occasionally horrid voice dubbing make this a wretched film Oddly while most will surely hate this film and that stupid kid there is a small and very vocal minority that love these films and compare them to Bergman and Kurosawa Dont believe themthis IS a terrible filmFYIApparently due to his terrific stage presence Gamera was featured in several more films in the 60s as well as some recent incarnations None of these change the central fact that he is a firebreathing flying turtle or that the movies are really really lame,0
1st watched 12242009 4 out of 10 DirRobert Ellis Miller Emotional Christmas fluff that doesnt really get specific enough to explain how the real story happened in this factualbased incident of a man who is wrongly put in jail trying to get a job for his family to make Christmas happen for them The three kids in the family then run away from home on a trek to Washington DC to enlist the then President of the United States Herbert Hoover This trek provides some side stories like their positive encounters with a hobo and a puppeteer which makes the story kind of like a Disney animals on the run movie and doesnt quite fit here At the ending there isnt any details given as to how the President helped the family and this is another downpoint to the movie in my opinion The movie does eventually bring tears but it takes too long to get to this The movie isnt supposed to have been an original TV movieaccording to IMDb but it has the obvious fadeouts that make it look this way so Im not sure their information is accurate All in all this is a simple moviethat could have been more complex with a happy Christmaslike story but blandly played and without a lot of substance,0
Let me state first that I love Westerns Civil War stories I also consider John Ford as an excellent director I also have the same high feelings for John Wayne William Holdens acting abilityI cannot remember if I saw this film when it first came out in 1959 Last night was the first time I saw it since thenAs per my 4 rating one can say I did not like the movieI now will attempt to tell some of its shortcomingsJohn Lee Mahin who wrote the screenplay from Harold Sinclairs novel was a very gifted writer wrote many fine scripts This script is poorly written badly researched They make mention of the awful conditions of the Andersonville prison At the time of the movie Andersonville was not in operation They also use rifles that were not used at the timeJohn Ford was directing films for over 40 years won 4 Oscars He must have been ill during the making of thisHis usual style was missing It could be that this was film in the south east and not in Monument ValleyHe normally had a stock company of players he used in nearly all his film MOST were missing this time This time only minor cowboy stars Hoot Gibson Ken Curtiss have roles of course Anna Lee has a small role There were no other familiar faces except for the 3 stars see below Mr Fords stock company made most of his films the classics they were sadly missed hereNow we come to the main stars John Wayne William Holden The Duke also must have been illhe seemed out of place here This sort of role usually fit his style perfectly he was just adequate here Wiliam Holden did the best he could but nowhere as good as he usually wasIt was required that there be an actress in this type of movie Here in her first major role second film is Constance Towers a very beautiful person But not really an actress She is still having roles on Television Let me be kind and say she has had a long careermore based on her looks than acting talent Also in caas as Ms Towers servant is Tennis Star Althea GibsonI am glad she stuck to tennisThe rest of the production credits were far from the usual high standard of other John Ford films There were a few military type songs supposedly done by the marching cavalry not good at all The action scenes were good but come at the end of filmRatings 12 out of 4 47 points out of 100 IMDb 4 out of 10,0
What the hell of a DMovie was that Bad acting bad special effects and the worst dialoguesstoryline i ever came across The only cool thing here was Coolio who had a nice cameo as a freaked out cop However the rest of the film is awful and boring Its not even so bad you can laugh about it Just plain crap And whoever compares this to the Evil Dead Series might as well compare Tomb Raider to Indiana Jones well ok at least there was Angelina Jolie in Tomb Raider 1 out of 10,0
The debut that plucked from obscurity one of the brighter stars of contemporary noir is an assured if limited stab at the con game and obsession Filmed for zero money Nolan couldnt have chosen a better subject than the drab and seamy underside of London to ply his trade given the lack of funds This short 67 min is at its best in playing with the audiences and protagonists expectations about who is scamming whom though the initial setup does ring some alarm bells in the credibility dept The muddy cinematography he often used natural lighting due to budget can be mostly chalked up to noir stylization though the limitations do show at timesOne can easily see Nolans style developing in this fledgling effort many of the same themes of blurred identity and expectation smashing recur in MEMENTO and INSOMNIA Not a masterpiece but good and certainly worth a look for modern noir and Nolan fans,1
A fine line up of actors and a seemingly nice plot though not original promised me a nice evening in front of the TV I was disappointed The actors delivered up to standard Juliette Lewis cuddly as ever William Hurt solid but in the background Shelley Duvall convincing as ever but the story was too thin to keep me engaged to the story and the twist to the finale was too obvious and too late there was only one character who was nice to he girl so guess what Then the final aftertwist I do not know what to think of that The boyfriend and the neighbor Contract with the Devil or just to get her to move in What The film had a nice idea behind it but the idea was not worked out in detail It could have been good but it was not Too many loose ends to tie up Columbo would say,0
Its really too bad that John Candy wasted his skills on so many horrible films Delirious Wagons East Whos Harry Crumb etc This one has maybe a few chuckles but its mostly just really bad oneliners and dumb physical stuff Lets honor this comedians memory by remembering things like Planes Trains Automobiles and Uncle Buck,0

Hopper has never been worse as if he felt as this movie is worthy of only a grade B performance and he delivers a rather good one Outside of Madsen and Hopper the acting is horrid youve seen better at your local high school The sound and at times the editing and camera shots are low end of Bmovies The scene with the peeping tom is of movies greatest gratuitous nudity scenes Ive ever seen it doesnt even come close to fitting in the movie The script was probably a great 10page outline but when it comes out to a fulllength movie there are more holes in it then the dead bodies Madsen left behind I do have to say Hopper dressed in a nice suit driving the Hummer had me laughing out loud but I dont think that was the intent Yes there is a little style and Hopper can always draw my interest However the interesting plot concept never pays off and you are left wondering why you wasted your time watching this,0
Although it is more of a kids movie it still holds its own especially when compared to the more recent assembly line animated films being made The music is fantastic I dont care how old you are you will still find yourself rockin to Girls of Rock and Roll and Diamond Dolls Definatly a must for animation lovers,1
This is not horror as the first part was This is campy light and humorous entertainment Like in so many sequels the action starts right away with no explanations But theres boobs so I dont complain And real boobs that is If I understand correctly those are quite rare today amongst the teenage girls in US of A Which brings to my mind the fact that the main actress here is Pamela Bruces sister SpringsteenThis cannot be thought without the first movie so I compare this to it Again there is too small clothing mainly pants and funny hair its not hard to tell what decade this film is made in Again there is really strange characters this time even more visibly pathological ones Especially the personnel of the camp Its like some mental rehabilitation summer camp People are older Most of the actors must be at least 25 but I think theyre supposed to be 16 or something Some methods used by the Evil Dyke are quite unpleasant Actually this movie dont have much in common with the first part and this is worse than it in every way,0
Sweet young nurse Charlotte Beale a charming performance by ravishing redhead knockout Rosie Holotik goes to work at a remote rural asylum run by Dr Geraldine S Masters the excellent Annabelle Weenick Among the motley assortment of colorfully crazed patients are insatiable aggressive nymphomaniac Allyson King the luscious Betty Chandler loopy Judge Oliver W Cameron a gloriously hammy Gene Ross paranoid Vietnam veteran Sergeant Jaffee nicely played by Hugh Feagin gentle giant Sam the amiable William Bill McGhee and nutty old hag Mrs Callingham the supremely irritating Rhea MacAdams Said patients are dangerously encouraged to act out their fantasies by Dr Masters which of course results in a rash of brutal killings Director SF Brownrigg working from a clever and suitably overwrought script by Tim Pope does an expert job of creating and sustaining a suffocatingly dank and brooding atmosphere of seething madness and oppressive claustrophobia Robert Farrars spooky score the grimy set design a few wild grisly murders Bruce B Alcotts grungy nofrills cinematography plenty of deliciously robust sceneryscarfing histrionics from a game noname cast Ross in particular is a total eyerolling hoot and the genuinely shocking surprise bloodbath conclusion further add to the overall infectiously seedy fun of this choice trashy chunk of 70s lowbudget regional horror exploitation cinema,1
Smithereens is the kind of worthless flick which just hangs out among the cable channels taking up space like a cheesy dime novel in the public library A worthless bit of tripe and first effort for mediocre director Seidelman the film is fraught with bad acting bad sound bad camera work and poor quality in all aspects of the film Many better films never make it to market and why junk flicks like this one do and never seem to go away is one of lifes great mysteries D,0
Worst DCOM I have seen Ever Well maybe not as bad as Smart House This was just bad The acting and story was fine but the effects SUCKEDThey were so fake The only good fight scene was between the brother and Shen That was probably the only scene in which I was excitedOverall I found this movie very boring and the film kind of ended suddenly I will give it a four for Brenda Song who is a very funny actress and that one fight scene410,0
Great acting on the part of Gretchen Mol This film is one of the best biopics to hit the screen in some time While it does cover the majority of Betties young life it also manages to stay on a mostly focused path which is something most biographical films seem to lack There is some lovely and alarmingly funny subtext in the dialogue and acting This film is an excellent break from the Dir of American Psycho and I think this will show through as her best work to date Oh and as a cinematography buff I give this film 100 in the cine dept It was amazing how well they pulled off a 50s look with modern film stocks Accolades to the DOP All around very enjoyable I recommend any interested to see it 810,1
someone needed to make a car payment this is truly awful makes jean Claudes cyborg look like gone with the wind this is an hour I wish I could sue to get back luckily it produced severe somnolence from which I fell asleep how can actors of this caliber create this dog I would rather spend the time watching algae grow on the side of a fish tank than partake of this wholly awful concoction of several genre I now use the DVD as a coaster on my coffee table 599 at walmart is far too much to spend on this movie if you really have to have it wait till they throw them out after they have carried them on the inventory for several years and are frustrated that they would not sellplease for the love of god let this movie die of obscurity,0
Poorly done political actioner Badly photographed acted and directed Every single scene is underlighted including those very few that are shot during the daytime It doesnt matter what the location is At an important conference in the White House no lights are on and the only available lighting is a gloomy blue that is filtered through a few windows The primier of China conducts an earthshattering phone conversation under conditions of such intense chiaroscuro that he should be contemplating a bust of Homer in a Rembrandt painting Honest Its as if he had a tiny spotlight on his face and was otherwise in total darkness The slow motion deaths are by now obligatory in any illthoughtout movieRoy Scheider and Maria Conchita Alonzo do well by their roles but Scheider is rarely on screen The other performances are dismissable There is a pretty Oriental woman in a short tight skirt who totes a gun and is right out of a Bond movie whos accent suggests a childhood spent in Basset Nebraska and who should have remained the model she probably started out as Whoever plays the surviving Secret Service agent aboard the cruise ship was probably picked for the part because he looked most like Johnny Depp not because of any display of talent The Chinese villains representing both Taiwan and mainland China hiss and grin as they threaten the heroes The script is pretty awful recycled from other better films There is a lot of shooting aboard the ship and practically everyone winds up mincemeat Two thirds of the way through the ship explodes into the expected series of fireballs Then the movie splits into two related parts Part one another shootout this time in a waterfront warehouse Part two an exchange between the Vice President now acting president and the oily Chinese premiere lifted out of both Dr Strangelove and Fail Safe We unwittingly launch our missiles They launch theirs in retaliation We cannot convince them that our launch was accidental even though we offer to help them destroy our own missiles There is even the George C Scott Walter Matthau general who argues that their nucular armory cant match ours so we should hit them with everything weve got More fireballs The end comes none too soon,0
This is a good film This is very funny Yet after this film there were no good Ernest films,1
Very entertaining and a great cast as noted Id like to add that Bruce Dern did a fine job also as is usually the case Worth renting if you can find it which has proved difficult for me Also note that the Amazon link from this page currently goes to a different movie of the same name,1
All the bare chested women in the world couldnt keep me from hitting the stop button about a third of the way through this awful rubbish With the derisory acting equally terrible script plus the poor CGI FX to match this movie is an insult to the Werewolf genre It is supposed to be serious which in itself would be funny if this film could even make it to the level of being a bad jokeThis is one of those movies where the people behind the camera are obviously competent but are too lazy to make something even one quarter decent Avoid at all costs and watch one of the classic Werewolf movies instead0 out of 10,0
The seasoned actors in this do know how to act and have proved that before but the Director who also wrote and produced this travesty is incompetent on so many levels OK its low budget but I know films students with lower budgets and lesser known actors who can do much much better For example since there were people involved who should know better some of the gun rigs were totally out of place and never existed in those days The stunt work was clumsy the story stale and hokey If some one gives you a copy of this use it for a coaster By the way I love westerns and have known many stunt men and even went to high school with one of the actors so I was looking for it to be good,0
A really very bad movie with a very few good moments or qualitiesIt starts off with pregnant Linda Blair who runs down a hallways to flee what might be monsters or people with pitchforks Im not sure She jumps through a window and wakes up and we see she is very pregnant The degree to which she is pregnant varies widely throughout the movieShe and an annoying and possibly retarded little boy who I thought was her son travel to an abandoned hotel on an island Italian horror directors find the most irritating little boys to put in their movies On the island already are David Hasselhoff and his Germanspeaking virgin girlfriend you know how Germans are said to love Hasselhoff Hes taking photographs and shes translating an esoteric German book about witches I thinkAlso traveling to the island are an older couple who have purchased it and a real estate agent and a woman I thought was their daughter Evidently she was an architect and Linda Blair and the boy are the older couples children I guess they all traveled to the island together but it really seemed like Linda and the boy were apart from the rest of them maybe they were filmed separatelyThe hotel seems neat certainly from the exteriors but it isnt used to any great effect An old woman in bad makeup and a black cloak keeps appearing to the boy and chants something in German sometimes which he eventually records on his Sesame Street tape recorderPeople start getting killed either in their dreams or sucked into hell or something Some of these gore scenes are OK but not enough to recommend the movie Though the copy I watched stated it is uncut on the box cover the death of one character whose veins explode really seems to have been cut Much of the scene is showing another characters reaction shots since were not seeing anything ourselves The creepiest scene is one in which a man or demon with a really messylooking wound of a mouth rapes someone He looked particularly nasty Theres a laughably and painfully bad scene in which Linda Blair is possessed I wish if a horror movie is going to cast her they would do something original with her role and let her leave Exorcist behind her except for the yearly horror conventionsIn the weird largely Italian tradition of claiming to be a sequel to something it is unrelated to this is also AKA La Casa 4 and Ghosthouse 2 That is it is supposedly a sequel to Casa 3 Ghosthouse La 1988 its not thats also a better movie than this one La Casa 1 and two were The Evil Dead 1981 and Evil Dead II 1987 again unrelated to Witchery and La Casa 3 and much better than those Theres also a Casa 5 La 1990 AKA House 5 which seems to want to be a sequel to the fake La Casa series and the series House House 1986 House II The Second Story 1987 The Horror Show 1989 AKA House III and House IV 1992 Hows The Horror Show fit in there It doesnt really it claimed to be a sequel thus requiring the real series entry to renumber itself to cause less or more confusion Oddly The Horror Show is also AKA Horror House and La Casa 5 is also AKA Horror House 2 Does your head hurt yet,0
Buddy ManucciRoy Scheider solid in a chance leading roleheads a secret undercover police squad called the SevenUps whose tactics dont necessarily follow the exact ways of the law They get the job done in their own way without anything being leaked to the press and this gives them a freedom to expand their means of getting to the criminals most working detectives and policeman just can not nab Buddy has a pal from childhood named VitoTony Lo Biancowho swaps information with him regarding mob types and shysters working the streets in NYC What Buddy doesnt know is that Vito is hatching a scheme using names from Buddys check listhe has this book open taking down notes provided by Vito but doesnt know that his friend has copied those very names written within his mindto set up mob families in a series of mob kidnappings eliciting cash thanks to two copposers Moonthe alwaysvillainous Richard Lynchand BoBill Hickmanworking with him When this scheme goes awry with one of the SevenUps being killed Vito becomes fearful because he knows how Buddy can be when hes doggedly after someoneespecially when one of his own is murderedExtremely underrated cop flick has thrilling car chase through New York City as Buddy follows the kidnapping copimposters trying to get them after killing his partner The film isnt overly complex after the plot is setup and we realize who is the ringleader in the scheming of mobsters Scheider has never been given the credit he deserves as a fine lead actor He has emotional range and we see how losing his cop and friend takes its toll on him The film is briskly paced with good action sequences and sets up an interesting plot of betrayal between friends as greed comes before that childhood friendship and how what seems like a smooth crimespree against evil mob families can get cops killed,1
Mr Destiny 355 StarsMr Destinys theme is recycled from many films spanning many different years Its theme ranges from recent spoofs on such plots see Scrooged to the same more serious and dramatic notion that worked in Its a Wonderful Life and a century earlier in the story of Scrooge as told by Charles Dickens in A Christmas Carol It involves an ungrateful man being taken on a guided tour of his life and witnessing how his life could have been or would have been firsthand In most of these types of movies the guardian angel rescues a man from ungratefulness and shows him his life in retrospect or how it could have been Should have been Would have been In this case we are shown a businessman named Larry James Belushi He hates his life He lives with an unexciting wife Linda Hamilton and yearns for a bigger life with bigger meaning If only he had hit the ball at the state championship in high school years ago He is convinced his life would have been better I guess he remembers this seemingly small moment of his life because it made a big impact on his subconscious side but I doubt a grown man would yearn for one single act from high school Still it works in the movieAnyway Larry is driving home from work one night where he is a penpusher along with Jon Lovitz when his car breaks down He wanders into a bar looking for a pay phone and reluctantly decides to tell the bartender Michael Caine about the way his life is turning out This is where we first see him remembering his childhood baseball strikeoutThe bartender listens and nods apparently not worrying about any other customers This is probably due to the fact that the bar though old and tattered seems to have never been occupied by any living humans save these two men In fact Larry even makes a comment about never seeing the bar before This is most likely for a certain reason that the audience is expecting before Larry So the bartender who may as well be an angel of God incarnate just like Clarence fixes Larry a special drink of his which ends up putting Larrys life on reverse showing him what his life would have been like if he had hit the home run all those years before But Larry has no idea of any change at first just like Jimmy Stewart didnt realize that Clarence had erased his life until he went into the bar and got kicked out Larry continues to be oblivious to any change until he goes to his home to find the lawn different outside and a large wrestlertype man occupying his homeLarry soon finds out his life would indeed have been very different had he hit the home run Instead of marrying Linda Hamilton he married Rene Russo and moved into a large mansion with children He finds out that Jon Lovitz is no longer his friend but an employee of his And the most surprising fact of all is that with his new life that Larry has always wantedhe finds himself lusting after his old wife Linda Hamilton proof that sometimes money and a greatlooking yet shallow wife dont make up everything in a mans life like an intelligent wife and love and true happiness Just like Its a Wonderful Life showed the audience a mans life is what he makes it and that every person has an impact on people Mr Destiny shows us that material wealth is not the same as spiritual wealth a lesson taught us over and over again but never quite so fluffy forgettable and truly sweet as it is shown us in Mr DestinyMr Destiny is never exceedingly hilarious but it is a sweet goodnatured comedy that never takes itself too seriously The problem with all the Its a Wonderful Life retreads out there like The Family Man is that they try to be as influential and memorable as Its a Wonderful Life was But there are only so many times you can singlehandedly rip off a famous film and Mr Destiny knows this and plays right to the fact It doesnt try to be anything it isnt rather it is something it didnt try to be and this is obvious to the audience,1
Blackadder 3 is probably the Blackadder series that people have least heard of it has basically the same principles as the second and fourth ones and has nothing revolutionary in it But it is still great a fiery Duke of Wellington and a fat foolish Dr Johnson writer of the first dictionary in England make this series one to be reckoned with There are still more hilarious oneliners to be delivered in this series and it brings out the humour in a lesserknown era in historically accurate and enjoyable episodes Blackadders third outing is not the most famous and wellknown of the lot but Rowan Atkinsons role as a butler to a stupid prince is a funny and effectively done one and Hugh Laurie is at his best in this series Very good 910,1
One of those el cheapo action adventures of the early 1980s that used to fill video rental stores solely to be taken out by adolescent boys in the hope of a cheap thrillWoeful down market attempt to cash in on the Death Wish phenomenon by substituting a moderately attractive woman for the visually challenging Bronson Acting is terrible sets are cheap the baddies are well bad Identification with any of the characters is unlikelyOnly redeeming feature is modest amount of gratuitous female nudity a smattering of which is full frontal Other than that you can leave it,0
This was a sordid and dreary mess I needed a shower when it was over It goes something like this some socialites are murdered and a woman homicide detective is assigned to the case She discovers that the victims belonged to an underground lesbian society and she befriends an associate of the group who may have relevant information Since the detective is an attractive woman of course she is horny and intrigued which reveals much about Hollywood and its psychosis about women Whats surprising is that none of this is very sexy or interesting just depressing and yucky Ellen Barkin gives a respectable performance as the lead detective and Julian Sands provides unintentional laughs as a crossdressing psychiatrist which is why it escapes a onestar rating,0
The King is Alive is a flawed and contrived mess of a movie which comes off like a self indulgent auteurs excuse to transport a bunch of actors to a Godforsaken Namibian desert where he can play majorDogmedomo and film his selfishly conceived silly overwrought drama with utter disregard for the real forces of human nature market appeal common sense and even good art In other words this is one dumbassed flick and if you dont believe that your penance is watching it Only for filmheads critics dilettantes and the like D,0

Few movies have dashed expectations and upset me as much as Fire has The movie is pretentious garbage It does not achieve anything at an artistic level The only thing it managed to receive is a ban in India If only it was because of the poor quality of film making rather than the topical controversy the ban would have been more justifiableNow that Ive got my distress out of my system I am more able to analyse the movie From the onset the movie feels unreal especially when the protagonists start conversing in English The director of course did not make the movie for an Indian audience however it underestimated its international audiences by over simplifying it Watching the character of the domestic help conversing in perfect English is too unreal to be true Next we get regular glimpses into Radhas dreams These scenes are not very effective They coming up as jarring and obstruct the flow of the movie Im still wondering how that philosophical dialogue connected to the story I felt that the surrealism was lost The love scenes felt voyeuristic and are probably meant for audience titillation rather than being a powerful statement In any case they do not achieve either of the two The names chosen for the women Radha and Sita are names of Hindu deities and hence been selected to shock the audiences However since the film wasnt meant for Indian audiences in the first place the shockthroughnameselection is not meant to achieve its goal which is absurd The quality of direction is very poor and some key and delicate scenes have been poorly handled A better director could have made a powerful emotional drama out of the subject The acting felt wooden although Nandita Das brought some life into the role the others were wasted I always thought that Shabana Azmi was a good actress but her talent is not evident in this film The male leads were outright rubbishIn case you are a fan of Earth and wish to see more of the director stay away from this one Please,0
I havent read through all the comments but at least one poster mentioned that the 30 minute version might possibly be abridged Im curious about that myself because the later parts of the film just didnt make much sense to me even when I rewatched them 30 minutes seems really short for a movie in 1917 also Poor Little Rich Girl which was Tourneurs next film is 65 minutes long and Pride of the Clan which was his previous feature was 84 minutes long So Im relieved to see that I wasnt crazy there must be part of this film missing and thats why the resolution didnt make much senseIts hard to review or comment on a movie that youre only able to see half of but I would recommend this film anyway because of the really fascinating view that it provides us of the insides of an East Coast movie studio of the time Its the earliest film Ive personally seen thats based on the movie industry itself The main character is a movie star played by Robert Warwick who was later a mainstay Hollywood character actor and appeared in almost all of Preston Sturges films He plays a western actor perhaps vaguely modeled on William S Hart who Warwick does resemble somewhat After the really fascinating sequences set in the studio we see them on a location shoot where he discovers a country girl Doris Kenyon and convinces her to come to New Jersey for a screen test which goes very poorly After that point the movie seems to be missing major pieces in the form we have nowAgain Id recommend it to anyone whos interested in film history for the documentary value but in the form we have it doesnt hold up much as a movie and isnt a particularly good example of Maurice Tourneurs work,1
My blurred childhood memories have kept the echo of the cult serie of Belphgor in the French 60s so I was eager to see the big screen adaptation I should have kept my money and gone for a stroll in the LouvreThe idea of the scenario is still very apt and interesting the fantom of Le Louvre but the adaptation is ridiculous The dialogues hesitate permanently between French irony and serious American business without achieving neither but not without sounding asinineActing leaves somehow to be desired and special effects are meager compared to what one could expect low budget What is left of all that Not much outside a few good shots of Paris which is seldom a disappointmentBelphgor was worth more than that,0
Mount GodwinAustin otherwise known as K2 is the worlds second highest mountain and if the evidence presented in this film is to be believed is the hardest mountain to climb successfully without getting yourself killed K2 is basically a buddy flick set in the breathtakingly dangerous world of mountaineering While the outdoor photography takes in some truly awesome scenery the characters standing in front of all those glorious landscapes are a crashing bore and therein lies the fault with the whole filmCocksure lawyer Taylor Brooks Michael Biehn and his quiet married friend Harold Jamieson Matt Craven spend their free time rock climbing During one of their trips they meet up with another bunch of climbers funded by wealthy mountain enthusiast Philip Claibourne Raymond J Barry Claibournes team are in training for a forthcoming shot at the infamous K2 a mountain that Taylor and Harold would both love to tackle but could never afford to do so During their training run however two of Claibournes team get themselves killed in an avalanche Taylor and Harold put themselves forward as potential replacements Despite initial reluctance Claibourne gives them the nod of approval and the pair find themselves joining his team in the Himalayas Harolds wife Cindy Julia NicksonSoul is distraught that her husband is going to take on such a dangerous climb especially since he has recently become a father Tensions in the climbing team mount as Taylor repeatedly clashes with another member of the group the equally brash and arrogant Dallas Woolf Luca Bercovici Meanwhile Claibourne himself grows increasingly ill as altitude sickness takes its toll on his body Will the guys reach the peak of K2 or is their quest destined to end in disappointment or even deathK2 spends an inordinately long time introducing its somewhat dislikeable characters Biehn as a foulmouthed pushy adventurous type is especially hard to like as is Barry as the hardnosed mountaineering millionaire But on the other side of the coin Craven is so dull that it becomes difficult to believe his wife could possibly give a damn about him going off to climb K2 heck shed be better off if he never came back Rounding off the main characters is Bercovici whose characterisation as Dallas Woolf is as campy and overthetop as every other role hes ever played The story itself is totally tame and disposable just a straightforward yarn about guys trying to reach the top of a mountain Theres a bit of male bonding thrown in but the whole subplot about Harold and his wife amounts to nil and the personality clashes between Taylor and Dallas ring totally false K2 scores its few merits solely from the stunning cinematography by Gabriel Berastain during the Himalayan sequences the scale and awe of the mountains is quite nicely captured Im completely with critic Kim Newman on this one who hilariously stated in Empire magazine On this evidence climbing K2 cant be any harder than sitting through it Quite true Kim quite true,0
Excellent and moving story of the end of a uniquely intimate affair Then again the point of the film to paraphrase another comment is that every relationship can be unique and intimate A truly quality short film which caught me at my busiest yet had the power to pull me down onto the sofa and watch fixed and quiet for the duration Bobby and Tessa are powerfully moving characters and anyone who has suffered the end of a love affair will find this film to be a cathartic exercise Beyond that the film within a film idea plays out very well with this cast and is quite riveting though in a somewhat melancholic way,1
Some martialarts purists think that comedy was the worst thing that could have happened to the oldschool kungfu flick and it is true that the introduction of comedy into the genre signaled the end of the chopsocky period in Hong Kong film But the fact is one can only carryon a primarily physical exhibition of prowess for just so long then everyone gets bored with it And thats really why the chopsocky died and how the Hong Kong New Wave action film was born the producers the actors the directors all just got bored with hitting people for ninetyminutes straightGiven that and given the fact that Liu Chia Liang is a professional director with a considerable list of films in his resume this film has to be seen as something other than just another kungfu comedy Rather it is a comic film within the martialarts genre and in fact one of the best ever madeWhat Liu has done with this film is really a pleasant surprise he has taken a martialarts plot and reconstructed it along the lines of a Hollywoodstyle musical Complete with episodes of singing and dancing It was around the time of the making of this film that some filmmakers and film fans began to recognize that the cinematic performance of martialarts really derived from the acrobatics of the Chinese opera has more in common with dance than with fighting I will continue to point out this connection until most Americans realize what they are actually supposed to look for when watching a martial arts film wellchoreographed body movements using the plot of an action film as an excuse for their performance At any rate quite clearly Liu Chia Liang made this connection and decided he would explore it close to its limitsThe result is an incredibly charming entertainment filled with marvelously human characters attempting miraculous kungfu and tripping over their own shoelaces as often as not when they do so and the film being set at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries allows Liu the opportunity to explore the nature of the Westernization and Modernization of China that contributed so greatly to the making of the China we know today So the film has considerable historical import as wellAlso fans of Stephen Chows recent Kung Fu Hustle should really watch this movie carefully as Chow clearly learned from it before the making of his own filmA very amusing wellmade film Oh yes and the kung fu in it is really really goodPurists wont admit it but this is probably director Lius best film,1
There are few films that have had me waiting and waiting for release more than this one This is the latest film from The Dead Gentlemen group responsible for the original Gamers film and the Demon Hunters films This group has not been terribly active over the last few years but this film is a definite reason to try and keep things up in following their progressThis film follows a group of gamers who are trying to finish a campaign run by a GM frustrated by his groups disregard for his story With the help of some new blood they attempt the campaign again with hopes of finishing this timeThis movie is a breath of fresh air in the movie community and a great improvement over the original The movie shows respect for the game much like the original movie did but on top of that this movie shows a dramatic improvement on special effects launching it above the simplicity of college films The acting is fairly decent and the jokes are quite funnyUnfortunately many of the jokes are in jokes so if you are not a gamer you may not find the film as funny as others So this is why I give the movie an 8 instead of the 9 that I initially thought of Any case if you are a gamer or know about gaming check this one out you will enjoy it,1
This film is amazing while not perfect by Hollywood standards it encompasses a gentle look at the wide divide between rich and poor black and white that is true in many parts of the world It handles the audience with kid gloves while delivering a truthful look at societal problems The children are beautiful take special note of the young man who plays Sipho The friendships that develop are universally true anyone can relate to the choices these young people have to make The influence of adults is interesting it appears to be taken from real life experiences as there are snipits of conversations and interactionsmuch like a child would remember experiencing I would highly recommend this film,1
Taken in the context of the time it was made I found this a worthwhile movie While the details may be dramatized the overall history was a nice primer In addition I found spotting actors I knew a real pleasure Who would imagine Ben Cartwright as a dastardly cad Ill leave the rest of the star spotting to you As to the secondary casting this movie as one would expect from a movie made in the late thirties has many an enjoyable character actor but top kudos to Andrew Jacksons right hand man Peavey The perfect touch of comedy Well shot with beautiful ships and competent acting throughout out I recommend this for anyone with a taste for the slightly camp or an eye for a doubleperiod piece set at the dawn of America and made in a period when great names and top notch character actors were a real pleasure to enjoy,1
This film is awful The CGI is the very cheap gray blob CGI The crocodile looks like a large gray smudge The worst is that no effort at all is given to making it walk or look like it is alive It is mostly a photoshopped CGI that is placed into scenes and you almost expect to see the hand that is moving the CGI smudge across the screen This is one of the worst examples of CGI effects that I have ever witnessed and I have seen lots of the very bad SciFi Channel moviesAside from the terrible lack of special effects the cast is composed of the typical lowcost actors who probably work as WaitersWaitresses at local diners while they wait for their Big Breaks Perhaps the most ridiculous scene in this movie is when one of the bad guys is attempting to sexually assault Kate and the giant crocodile jumps straight up out of the water to the second floor of the Villains Headquarters and through the balcony and pulls the bad guy off Kate and instead of crashing straight down through the building and crushing Kate the Croc just flies backwards at the same angle into the water No laws of Physics can apply to this movie or the special effects At least there is honor among crocodiles,0
I hadnt planned on seeing this movie however I wasnt disappointed when a friend dragged me along Although there are no real surprises here the guys do reasonably well with their obviously modest budgetIf youve seen the trailer you probably know what to expect from this type of movie and theres a pretty constant stream of jokes here with a couple of classic moments with the highpoint probably being an excellent flashback to what the guys were like in the 1980s Also Ive read elsewhere that the ending was a disappointment but I found it refreshingly different from what I had expected from this genreOverall this movie wont change your life but its got enough laughs there to keep you entertained throughout,1
I dont know why I picked this movie to watch it has a strange title and from the description it just looked like something different Every once in a while its good to try a film thats slightly different from the mainstream Hollywood herothriller flick and this film certainly was different Right from the beginning this film had me intrigued but I couldnt figure out why until the end if the film when I realized that the movie was great because the characters were so real I thought the acting was superb and the character development really makes you care about them and hope things turn out well for them in the end I think that everyone who watches the film could in some way relate to one of the characters and this makes for great viewing and some good laughs at the sheer ordinariness of the actors At the culmination of the movie you definitely get a sense of well being and are left with the things are going to be OK type of a feeling Im sure this will have wide appeal and should be given a chance,1
The music of Albeniz pervades this film Once and a while it is played with original instrumentation eg piano but never full orchestra but often it is reworked with various contemporary ensembles egguitar and treatments eg jazz piano Only occasionally is the music the sole focus of the film the vast majority of the time the music is set to various dances often flamenco but not always I would guess that there are 1214 scenes which are not united by a plot Not all scenes will reach the heights for an individual viewer In my case about half reached the pinnacle though all the rest were in their own way very fine Those that worked for me moved me to gooseflesh aesthetic delight indeed the final scene left me weepy with joy And in some very magical way it brings you deep into Spanish culture If you dont like subtitles dont worry The film is virtually wordless though each scene carries a title of an Albeniz piece Seeing this very beautiful film sharpens my complaint that virtually none of the films of Saura are available on DVD in the USA I am thinking here particularly of his flamenco version of Carmen a spectacular work of art that is available in Europe but not here European DVDs wont play on American DVD players This is a scandal,1
This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen However the little slave girl Alice and Jared Harris imitating Christopher Walken is what makes this movie entertaining Alices smoking drinking and uncanny way of showing up when her name is called is strange and interesting I have to applaud Jared for his Christopher Walken imitation and Christopher Walken for allowing this to be in the movie,0
I have done a lot of international travel both on business and as a tourist For both types I assure you the best advice is also the oldest Always drink the wine of the country In this movie the archangel Michael comes to Earth on business wraps it up quickly and decides to hang around for a little touring Boy Does he drink the wine of the countryCould man be drunk forever with liquor love and fights Hed lief rise up of mornings and lief lie down of nightsThese are things you cant do in Heaven so he enjoys them while hes here Of course it turns out he had a couple of other jobs to tackle and if he is less direct about them than he was about the first one he is just as successful The final scene is a little schmaltzy but it is also wonderful Jean Stapleton gets to dance with John Travolta,1
The movie is bad Nothing special just a kid movie with no serious thing in it There is though one reason to watch this for the animal talk Some of them are so funny in what they say you just cant stop laughing So if you want to hear a dog in the dog pound saying Im Keyser Soze or another animal saying Youre a dead cat walking or many other funny one liners see it Cause theres no other good movie to watch it Vote 4 out of 10,0
The first 10 minutes of the movie makes fun of sequels and pg13 movies These are the 2 reasons the movie is so bad They constantly reference a movie called Get Leo which is the movieinamovie version of get shorty Every time they do this you will be really angry Travolta isnt very cool neither is Keitel However The Rock and Vince Vaughn are hilarious They arent the kind of funny you would expect to see in an Elmore Leonard movie though If you havent seen get shorty you will probably like be cool If you liked get shorty you will leave the theater wanting to kill the director and screenwriter Wait for the DVD,0
When I first watched Robotboy I found it fresh and interesting but then I noticed that with each episode this show is trying to teach you how to behave yourself what is goodbad Episodes became predictable And main characters are not interesting Again we see a hypersmart boy beaten by his older brother parents who dont understand their kid and his friends girl and fat boy Also this show has no logic A supermodern robot who works on two AAsize batteries and can use a lot of weapons But the biggest problem is the difference between activated and superactivated modes We see two different robots and it declines main idea of the show Robot must learn how to behave himself in human society,0
I rented this DVD having seen it while looking for something else When I saw the title on the jacket I couldnt believe my eyes I read Yaloms book about a year ago and loved it in fact admire Yaloms work in general I am a clinical psychologist I have watched perhaps 30 minutes of this movie and have had to turn it off Im not sure if I can take much more At a superficial level the faux accents as others have commented are simply distracting at best and irritating and vapid at worst The acting is dull when it should be passionate and comical when it should be serious The portrayal of Lou Salome is simply flippant and the brilliant Freud comes off as little more than a schoolboy I see very little of the books spirit conveyed thus far I had hoped to be able to recommend this film to my students Instead I will refer them to the book Imagine that,0
The second Mr Eko episode has somewhat less interesting flashbacks than the first The 23rd Psalm but in just about every other department it is one of the best episodes of Season 2 advancing the series mythologybackground as well as the characters A new Dharma Initiative station The Pearl is discovered by Locke and Eko and the orientation film that they find and watch inside completes Lockes transformation from a believer Orientation after the end of the film Were gonna have to watch this again to a doubter SOS Did you push that button Henry I need to know to a nonbeliever after the end of the film Do you want to watch this again No Ive seen enough Terry OQuinns performance is powerful as usual every single second of my pathetic little life is as useless as that button Meanwhile Eko takes his place as the man who becomes sure that he was brought on the island as part of his true destiny which is to continue pushing the button Other high points of are a startling unique dream sequence where person A has the dream as being person B this is the kind of bold idea that the current season of LOST could use much more of and the haunting scene of Libbys last word before her death and the way Jack and Hurley cannot possibly know its true meaning 12 out of 4,1
Having decided some time ago to collect the films of Billy Bob Thornton on the strength of class movies like Sling Blade A Simple Plan and The Man Who Wasnt There amongst others it was inevitable that there would be the odd turkey in there What I didnt realise however was that there could be one THIS bad Ill give you an idea how incredibly poor this film is the funniest dialogue in it goes like this Knock Knock Whos there The big stinking man The big stinking man who The big stinking man is YOU Yes folks it really is that bad Billy Bob is only in it for about two minutes I guess he needed the work at that time in his career and the rest of the movie is painful For some reason though although its undeniably awful I dont hate it Thats probably because I save my ire for any high budget special effects laden junk like The Fast and the Furious and not a nobudget flick like this one 210 at a push,0
A lot people get hung up on this films tag as a childrens film and that it certainly is though it is one made for adults Takashi Miike uses the fantasy genre particularly the childrens fantasy genre as a springboard into the wild territory that is the Great Yokai WarThe setup is simple a boy is selected to play the hero in this years annual festival only to discover his role is much more real than he could have imagined What follows is a hallucinatory grotesque whimsical and often funny journey through the world of Japanese folklore but wait theres also an evil Villain on the lose who wants to destroy the world However the villain here is not a mere demon it is the demonspirit of the accumulated resentment of those things which humans use and discard Usuing a chamber made out of pure liquid hateresentment the villain transforms the vibrant colorful Yokai spirits into soulless ten foot tall makeshift robots which chainsaw for arms and eyes like burning coalsthose whove played the video game Sonic The Hedghog might remember a certain Dr Robotnik performing similar procedures to the cute and cuddlys who Sonic had to then liberateThe hero in this film is actually the least interesting character essentially playing the straight man in a world gone suddenly mad Though he does go through the typical heroes trials he more often than not cowers as do many of the Yokia themselves who seem truly defenseless against the murderous robots some spirits being umbrellas with eyes talking walls or creatures whose soul purpose in life is to count beansof course in this magical world of Miikes Yokai war even beans take a magical power when one believes in themIn several ways this film subverts the normal conventions of childrens fantasy as few if any of the characters are heroic their victory being a combination of happenstance almost arbitrary faith and a desire to party The Yokai spirits only rally together and lay siege the villains hideout after they mistake the end of the world invasion of Earth for a great Yokai festival and even then only to dance and party Also the film ends not with the usual celebratory alls well that ends well fantasy ending but with a final scene showing our hero years older with an adult job now unable to see the Yokai spirits of his youth who then despondently turn to the villain who being a spirit can never really die This ending with its Yokai spirit who is the spitting image of Pokemons Pikachu warns us not just of leaving behind our childhood selves but of the horrors of overconsumption The villain is resentment caused when humans no longer have reverence for the world and the objects around themin Japanese folklore nearly every object has some kind of spirit and so when they are used and discarded as we in consumer societies do without reverence they become soulless vengeful machines not unlike those seen in modern video games suggesting that though our imaginations and myths do not ever really die but can become deformedThis is one of the first scripts Miike has contributed to and I believe it shows as theres a tightness conceptually that sometimes gets swept under the rug by his exuberance for visual playfulness Though Ive focused mostly on the story since lots of users here seem to write it off I do want to say that visually its a kaleidescope of CGI stop animation costume and live puppetry that works remarkably well Theres a dreamlike quality to a lot of the film and the Miyazaki comparisons are warranted as are the NeverEnding Story and Labrynth comparisons though this film is sharper and more adult than either The Yokai are beaten brutalized and turned into machines of living hate who I believe even kill a few humans a deformed aborted calf with a mans face is born and dies in the films grotesque opening while a sexual undercurrent the women with the long neck licking the face of our boy hero or another characters persistent memory of touching the thigh of a young scantily clad water spirit as a boy seem to linger a bit too long for most western tastes especially when considering this is a childrens film However these are slight enough to catch adult attentions while minor enough not to traumatize any children to bad Grims fairy tales before revisions did much worse far more oftenAll and all this is one of Miikes most accessible and engaging ventures yet with enough visual drama and great performancesthe Yokai spirits have a humanism and an absurd humor to them thats laugh out loud funny at times to appeal to audiences of all ages and a steady conceptual undercurrent strong enough to draw in an adult audience who have presumably brought their children or else come out of a sense of nostalgia for the long lost fantasy films of their youth The latter group the film seems to address the most fervently asking that they not just continue passive consumption of the world around them but show reverence to those spirits within them which seemed so much closer to reality in childhood Another beautiful funny and truly original film from a thrilling director who hasnt come close to his apex Instant classic,1
The choice to make this SNL skit into a movie was far better thought out than other recent ones The humor involved in the character is not annoyance humor and is also character driven enough to be stretched out for an hour or twoOddly enough the sexual content seemed like it could be avoided but that may have been because the constraints of live television schooled me to not expect it I suppose I was thinking more Leisure Suit Larry risqu than the producers wereDefinitely not a PG13 movie which will probably hurt it from ever reaching the heights of its more successful predecessors but still better premise and writing than its more dismal onesI liked it but I doubt it will be a smash hit which is sad as Tim Meadows tends not to do characters that annoy me with quite the frequency other SNL alumni tend to,1
I chose to watch this film because I am a Stephen Nichols fan Unfortunately I am unhappy with Mr Nichols choice to do this movie The film was slow badly acted and included some very graphic sex scenes of Mr Nichols character with a very young woman Watch at your own peril,0
You dont need to read this reviewAn earlier review by pninson of Seattle has already identified all the main shortcomings of this production I can only amplify its basic argumentsBleak House was a relatively late Dickens novel and is much darker than his earlier work This is taken too literally by the director Ross Devenish who piles on the gloom and fog too much When Ada Rick and Esther appear half an hour into the opening episode it is a relief just to be in daylight for the first time In some of the murkier scenes it was hard to see what was actually on my TV screen I watched the whole thing in one day starting in midafternoon As daylight faded this became less of an issue but I have a pretty good TV and I have never encountered this problem before at any time of dayThe pacing is very deliberate ie slow I am sure this was intensional but it is overdone There are numerous shots of people trudging though the muck and gloom of Victorian London that are held longer than is necessary to establish the mood and atmosphere A good editor could probably take several minutes out of each fiftyminute episode without losing a line of dialogue just by trimming each of these scenes slightlyI dont want to overstate these two problems You soon adjust to the look and pace of this production The more important issue is that it doesnt always tell the story very effectively Earlier Dickens novels are as long as Bleak House but are not nearly so intricately plotted For example I recently reread Nicholas Nickleby because I was intrigued to see how Douglas McGrath crammed an 800 page book into his twohour movie The answer is simple the book is full of padding McGrath cut great swathes of the novel while still retaining all the essential story elements This would not be possible with Bleak House This production needs its seven hours Probably it needs even longer because many elements of its convoluted plot are not sufficiently clear or as well handled as they need to be A few random examples will illustrate the problemsThe maid Rosa appears from nowhere with no background so Lady Dedlocks attachment to her is largely unmotivatedSergeant Georges acquiescence in Tulkinhorns demand for a sample of Hortons handwriting is somewhat fudgedIt is not made clear enough that Esther is actually in love with Woodcourt when she agrees to marry John Jarndyce Neither is it clear that they have agreed not to announce their engagement or whyAda and Ricks secret marriage is omitted In one episode they are merely lovers in the next people are suddenly referring to them as husband and wifeMrs Rouncewell is only introduced at a late stage in the story and Sargeant Georges estrangement from his family is left unexplained as is the means by which she is discoveredTulkinhorns dedication to maintaining the honour and respectability of the Dedlock family is understated so his motive for persecuting Lady Dedlock is more obscure than it need beThe involvement of the brick makers with both Tom and later Lady Dedlock is somewhat opaqueIt is not obvious that Guppy renews his offer to Esther because her smallpox scars have all but vanishedThis is only a selection there are others They are not major problems and the main thrust of the story is clear enough Nonetheless they are minor irritations that detract from its power you shouldnt have to puzzle over little plot points However there are more important structural problems that do weaken the story in its later stagesThe whole business of Tulkinhorns murder is somewhat thrown away Bucket immediately pinpoints Hortense as a suspect which undermines the suspense of Sergeant Georges predicament and the importance of finding Mrs Rouncewell It also diminishes the impact of the subplot in which suspicion is thrown on Lady Dedlock and weakens the scene in which Hortense is unmasked in front of Sir LesterA more serious problem is that the murder its investigation and the subsequent search for Lady Dedlock dominate the story for over an hour during which time we completely lose sight of the other main plot strand the legal case and its effect on Rick His failing finances his gouging by Vholes and Skimpole Adas despair his declining health and so on are all put on hold for an entire episode This may be how Dickens wrote the book I havent read it for years but a good screenplay should keep the different plot strands moving forward togetherFinally Smallweeds role in the story is so diminished that he is almost superfluous His discovery of the new will that triggers the final phase of the story is also thrown away It happens off screenDespite all of this it is still a very good production Many of the performances are outstanding Individual scenes are beautifully realised Its accumulating sense of tragedy is very powerful I would still be recommending it as a superb adaptation of a great book had it not been for the 2005 production In fact I probably wouldnt be fully aware of its defects if I hadnt seen how Andrew Davies did it better I have been critical of Daviess Jane Austen adaptations but I have to admit that he really knows how to tame Dickenss sprawling booksThis is an impressive and gripping drama and well worth seven hours of anybodys time Nonetheless its probable fate is to be viewed mainly as a crossreference to the neardefinitive 2005 version,1
In the early 1990s StepbyStep came as a tedious combination of the ultracheesy Full House and the longdefunct loopy classic hit The Brady Bunch The differences between StepbyStep and the two aforementioned shows was of course better writing excellent comedic timing from almost all of its actors and a great deal funnier situations that werent quite as sugarcoated as its extremely popular predecessors Admittedly though even with the big boosts in the shows basic dynamics and all it still wasnt exactly spectacular nor was it really even that memorable in the long line of corny family programming It was just a much better timepasser you might say in comparison to the cutesy migraineinducing Full House which coincidentally ran neckandneck with StepbyStep during that time period in terms of overall popularity The show now in syndication obviously is certainly suitable familyfare but be sure to not expect much beyond that when watching it,0

This show lasted for most of the 1980s and had its moments but plots were usually dishwater thin and often painfully unfunnyTerry Scott and June Whitfield were wasted in this sitcom they both deserved better but it does provide some fond memories and I have found myself smiling at some repeated scenes June Whitfields talent for comedy is allowed to shine through on occasion when she is not being a foil to Terry and she really is cleverThe 1980s is the last decade where you will find this kind of middle class middle aged comedy and many people remember it fondly but I prefer to remember the decade for alternative comedy and the biting satire of Spitting Image,0
This movie was recommended to me by the same person that blessed me with a copy of The Chronicles of Narnia Shadowlands is one of the most amazing screenplays ever written It is well executed acted and directed The cinematography is a bit dark for my taste but Im sure it was intended to be so The screenplay is like poetry in portions of the movie through out the movie I found myself taking pause to reflect on the comments just made on screen This is a wonderful piece of cinema and I can only hope that more people will run across it and add reviews Fair warning though this was a 6 tissue movie for me Very touching Very Heartfelt performances,1
This movie was terrible to say the least I was hoping for a lot better after seeing High School Musical The whole entire movie was a complete rip off of The Simple Life only it wasnt a reality showThe acting was not good at all Amanda Michalka had her moments when she wasnt that terrible On the other hand Alyson Michalka was bad all the way through Chris Gallinger who played the love interest of Amanda was playing a french guy but had an awful accent One good thing about this movie was the completely adorable Michael Trevino who played Alysons love interest Just something to keep in mind if this movie had been aired before High School Musical it probably would not have seemed as bad But it was no comparisonOverall I give it a 2,0
This game show lasted just one season but was intriguing to audiences because it required visual aptitude and a steady hand One false move would disqualify the contestant from winning the prize even though it was clear the contestant knew the correct answer It was always exciting as the contestant began drawing wondering if they would complete the drawing or be buzzed out allowing the other contestant to easily win the contest It was a lighthearted show but it was clear that the contestants were often times embarrassed from a silly mistake made unintentionally Rarely seen the game show did not survive past one single season Only a seasoned game show addict will remember this show as it proved to be quite unpopular even though game shows were making a big return to the TV screen after the scandals of the 1950s game shows But it was a unique concept for a game show and one that has as yet never been seen again,1
Not many people remember The Carey Treatment and I cant say I blame themBlake Edwards did this during his lean years ie between Pink Panther movies and for a story of a doctor turned detective Coburn working to solve a murder in his hospital its actually pretty forgettableCoburn is dependable as always and ONeill is beautiful as always but there just seems to be something missing from the proceedings The story twists and turns arent very involving and even the climax which is supposed to be nervewracking is gutwrenching insteadA missed opportunity altogether and an unfortunate one at that since it was based on a Michael Crichton book Oh well at least Crichton didnt write a sequel to itOne star Carey on Coburn,0
As a producer of indie movies and a harsh critic of such I have to say I loved this movie It is funny and intelligent well directed and entertaining Hats off to the producers and directors for making a good one Ill be watching for the next one I gave it a 10,1
No matter how well meaning his message is this film is a terribly made trainwreck awful acting lame camera work I do not know why Carr agreed to try and pull off a stutter he is lousy at it You watch the extras on the DVD and the way he has a camera follow him around he just soaks it up he loves being the center of attention He is a bad actor he reminds me of another arrogant filmmaker Eric Schaffer Some how Carr has had this film shown at city Youth Centers and New Age churches where damaged people looking for reinforcement and attention themselves babble on about how the film touched them and maybe it did but as a film itself it is choppy predictable and sappy,0
Okay so there is a front view of a Checker taxi probably late 1930s model It has the great triangular shaped headlights There also is a DeSoto cab in this black and white character driven almost a musical love gone wrong storyThe real pleasure here is the look at 1940s room interiors and fashions and hotel elevators The hair styles male and female are gorgeous If Dolly Parton had Victor Matures hair she could have made it big There is an artist loft that would be the envy of every Andy Warhol wannabeIf you watch this expecting a great Casablanca storyline or Sound of Music oompahpah you will be disappointed There is a nice little story beneath the runway model approach in this filmMy copy on DVD with another movie for 1 was very viewable The title sequence was cute but not up there with Mad Mad Mad Mad World or The Pink Panther This was an RKO movie but it did not have the nice airplane logo that RKO used to useI liked Victor Mature in One Million BC and Sampson and Delilah and especially in Violent Saturday See if you can find that one He was wonderful in the comedy with Peter Sellers called Caccia Alla Volpe or After The FoxRichard Carlson went on to do I Led Three Lives on TV in the early 1950sVic Mature was offered the part of Sampsons father in the remake of Sampson and Delilah He supposedly was asked if he would have any problems playing the part of the father since he was so well known as Sampson Victor replied If the money is right Ill play Sampsons mother Tom Willett,1
The actors are so bland that its almost impossible to tell them apart Pauline Kael said of this movie The actors have names but theyre truly anonymous and the special effects are really bad They simulate weightlessness with people hanging on cables and by recycling the trick that let Fred Astaire dance on the ceiling in Royal Wedding but none of these guys move well enough to make it look convincing The low point of the movie is when one of the characters an airplane tycoon is trying to convince some other giants of industry to come in with him in a moonrocket consortium and he shows them a Woody Woodpecker cartoon that explains how a rocket works at a 2nd grade level And to think that Robert Heinlein worked on the screenplayThe only plus is that the production design manages to communicate a sort of Amazing Stories sensibility and even that is done much better in the producers George Pal subsequent movie When Worlds Collide which has similar bad acting but is much more entertaining However Pals best scifi movie has to be The Time Machine,0
I found this a very enjoyable light hearted comedy set in Wales with some truly funny sequences highlighting the rivalry between two funeral directors The showbiz ideas used by Christopher Walkens character to liven up his funerals are genuinely laugh out loud moments,1

I am insulted and angry over the idea that a sequel to Gone with the Wind should EVER have been undertaken Having expressed that I have no problem with the quality of the acting or the actors in this film The performers are talented people whose talents were wasted on this piece of garbage The hype surrounding this book and film just happens to be an exercise in futility I think it will go down as one of the misguided films of Hollywood I dont believe that the beloved characters created by Margaret Mitchell should have been soiled by the ideas and interpretations of another writer The film and the book should be on the list of worst ideas conceived in the world of publishing and filmmaking The sad thing is that people actually made money off of this tripe,0
One of the most disturbing and tragic periods in American history began The members of the Summer of Love culture at the end of the seventies and onset of the 80s were eventually tool old for love beads and all night parties and evolved back into mainstream life whatever that meant For those who could not out grow their youthful and sometimes irrational exuberance theirs was the culture of Wonderland A love for drugs and a sense of entitlement coupled with a distaste for authority values and the establishment is the world that the film captures The sixties were a time of revolution and violent change that tore the American house apart Once the battles were over we all had to deal with the aftermath of the carnage The characters in the Wonderland house are icons of the misfits of the Seventies part biker part hippie part crook all outcast No ideology to express just a sense of dissatisfaction with everything and allegiance to nothing Ron Billy and David fancy themselves as some sort of Robin Hoods with dope They talk of love and behave violently they take from the rich and sell to the misbegotten they steal from everyoneHolmes and company are the end result of a strange collision of antimatter like sex and drugs and rock roll when the lab technicians get bored and move on The film is skillfully directed and paced and captures the frenetic world of the drug fiends in their element The fact that Holmes is a porn star is almost irrelevant That story was told in Boogie Nights This is a story of a transitional and forgettable era,1
This films premise is so simple and obvious that only a Texas millionaire high on oil fumes and whiskey would have a problem understanding it if someone shouted it across the proverbial parking lot In summary the oil business is in cahoots with The Government or Gummint if you prefer the Gummint is in cahoots with Middle Eastern despots and the CIA is a singular festering pool of double dealing sonsofinsert word willing to toe any line that comes their way The only people that get done over are the good ones like Mr Clooney Bob Oh and terrorism is a result of the poverty which globalization creates when wicked multinationals stalk the world looking for a tasty takeover or three That really fits to the profiles of the wellheeled 911 perpetratorsIn Syriana this facile tissue of political halftruths and Hollywood holograms is stirred up in a repugnant vermicelli of story strands that twist turn and whirl through the gloopy circumlocutions of their own insignificance until the poor viewer is left alone with the conclusion that 1 the director good joke should never be let near a camera again 2 people like Clooney and Hurt might know how to act but they sure dont know how to pick a script 3 if you want to see a film that deals with corruption in big business and the state go and see Claude Chabrols Livresse du pouvoir which is insightful funny and brilliantly acted Empty doomladen sententious piffle spun out to eveningruining length,0
Fairly appalling enterprise suggests Welsh to be an infantile artist helplessly drawn to the violent milieu he knows best but unable to resist vacuous elaborations rooted in banal fantasy The first story is a hamfisted meaningless trudge with a Bmovie scifi premise The second achieves some poignancy but only via the outrageinducing surplus of humiliation visited on its central character The third and most risible seems to aspire to being a dislocated sequel to Childs Play The direction is consistently clueless all whirling sound and fury a slave to the extreme unpleasantness of the environment suffocating in an illchosen music score and in indifferently flashy acting This is sheer stupidity masquerading as a guerilla sensibility as arbitrary and hollow as the abstract images that link the three sections,0
This is a snuff movie Im shocked it is even considered to be in the IMDb library And Bill Julia and all other professional actors involved should be ashamed to be part of this sick flick I thought I was going to view a somewhat classic horror film with a creative end that writers like to inventthat usually make no sense when writing a horror film but as a viewer we try to rationalize and understand This ending was not creative It was sick and has all the earmarks of a snuff movie I am shocked it was edited to this ending and more shocked that it will be out for distribution by the end of June 2009 It should not be shown in a theater It is harmful to innocent minds on many levelswatch the movie the ending and you will understand this statement Plus included in the plot is a sweet little girl not yet 9 her character says She is not in the snuff ending but she is an integral part of the movie Why do directors feel they need to shock with a sick flick in order to get recognition The director is in the wrong line of work if she thinks this is an art film,0
The 60s is a great movieI saw it completely in one night about the hippy movement in the late 60s Although the title would suggest otherwise the first 5 years of the 60s are not really important in this filmThe main character of the movie is Michaela political activist who goes on the road in the US against the Vietnamwar There he meets his girlfriendSarahMichaels brotherBriangoes to Vietnam to fightwhat a surpriseHe comes back from the war and changes in a Tom Cruise Born on the fourth of July look a like and then into a HippyHis dad is a provietnam war type of guywhat a surpriseMichaels sister Kate gets pregnant from a Rock Roll artist and runs away from home and goes to San Francisco during the summer of love The ending is very poorfather becomes a liberal and everybody is happybut I let this slip away from my votethe rest of the movie is very good The performances by the actors are pretty good and the soundtrack of the movie is absolutely brilliant All the main events of the sixties are in the movielike the murders on JFK and Martin Luther King aswell as the big hippy proteststhe summer of love and Woodstock Look closely for WavyWoodstock SpeakerGravyWhat we have in mind is breakfast in bed for 400000 as a first aid employee at the Woodstock festivalIn the endthe 60s is a beautiful movie about a beautiful decade 1010,1
Unless somebody enlightens me I really have no idea what this movie is about It looks like a picture with a message but its far from it This movie tells pointless story of a New York press agent and about his problems And thats basically all When that agent is played by Pacino one must think that it must be something important But it takes no hard thinking to figure out how meaningless and dull this movie is To one of the best actors in the world Al Pacino this is the second movie of the year the other is Simone that deserves the title the most boring and the most pointless motion picture of the year So whats going on Al,0
While it was filmed at a Florida National Guard site Tigerland totally reminded me of Fort Polk LA firing ranges maneuver areas waistdeep water and all The movie was fairly authentic and the characters similar to those same ones at my AIT in 1974 The difference between the Tigerland year 1971 and mine of 1974 is all the drill sergeants and instructors knew they werent going back to Vietnam as it was pretty much all over so training was very relaxed not a challenge at all That was the precursor to all our troubles in the 70s and 80s which I know for a fact as I stayed in until 2004 I never heard anyone mention Tigerland but the Army did have realistic Vietnam training villages at different bases across the US Vietnam Vets tell me that up to 1972 Basic AIT could be pretty rough and rugged because the trainers had been there and were mandated to train Vietnambound men those skills to make it although that was not always the case Both a drill sergeant at Polk and later one of my Vietnam Vet NCOs when we had become instructors at a basic training brigade at Fort Bliss told me there was nothing they could do to get anyone ready and people just had to find out and figure out for themselves This movie rates high,1

Stripperella is an animated series about a girl named Erotica Jones voiced by Pamela Anderson who lives a double life as a stripper at a gentlemans club known as The Tender Loins and as a sexy crimefighter known as Stripperella aka Agent 69 who works for a government organization As Stripperella Erotica fights crime and the forces of evil such as a plastic surgeon who gives women breast implants that either explode or make them fat and Cheapo a criminal who steals from 99 cent stores and makes his two henchmen share a gun The creator of the character and the series is Stan Lee of Marvel fame and creator of SpiderManBack in late June of 2003 Spike TV then known as The New TNN premiered a Thursday night block of three animated shows Those shows were Ren Stimpy Adult Party Cartoon new adventures of classic kids show characters Ren and Stimpy for adults done by original creator John Kricfalusi Gary the Rat about a lawyer who is turned into a human sized rat starring Kelsee Grammar of Cheers and Fraiser fame and Stripperella the adventures of a stripper who doubles as a superhero voiced by Pamela Anderson and created by Stan Lee I remember seeing all three of the premiers I was anxious to see Ren and Stimpy as I love the original show I was a little let down It was alright but it seemed to take things a little too far seeing the two have gay sex together was a bit much Though Gary the Rat wasnt bad the best of the three was easily Stripperella The animation was really good it had an awesome intro song it had some good talent behind it and it was funny as hell The show was just so silly I dont even know how to begin explaining it After four of five weeks if not a little less the animation block disappeared which was weird because I know it got good ratings and it was advertised everywhere I was disappointed to see Stripperella go but several months later I found out about new episodes that aired at like 100 AM I only got to see one and though it was funny as hell and I was glad to see the show back after all that time something seemed a bit offIn the beginning of its short run Stripperella had great animation It was dark moody realistic and somewhat sexy too The Stripperella costumed looked good too the character was drawn well After the long hiatus and during the rest of the episodes the animation was very different Instead of dark and realistic look it originally had everything was now really colorful and cartoonish Stripperella received the biggest changes though Before she had normal long hair now she had hair bigger than Peggy Bundys Married with Children if even possible Also the eye mask actually shows her eyes now before it was just white you saw which was cool since it was more superheroish Also the upper part of her costume was kind of a vesttype thing with a collar and her costume was dark blue that changed to her costume being a bluishviolet color and her upper costume being really crappy looking in comparison In short the show was a cartoon and very over the top silly beforehand but the secondhalf it became more cartoonish looking and though still laughoutloud hilarious it became more zany as well for example there was a later episode about a werebeaveryes a werebeaver Anyway instead of complaining about the midseries changes Stripperella only ran one season but it was a very good show Like the Tales from the Crypt film Bordello of Blood it may be really campy but its really fun As long as your not a prude youll find yourself laughing repeatedly at this show I havent seen every episode because I havent got the DVD yet for two reasons 1 Paramount released and they have this screwed up policy about not including any extras on nearly all released TV shows even though this was the entire show I would have liked to see some commentarys maby explaining the animation change and interviews with Pamela Anderson and Stan Lee and 2 the awesome Kid Rock song during the opening was replaced Now Im not a fan of his but that intro sang WAS the theme for the show If your not going to pay to have any extras at least pay to have the original intro song you jackasses The show also had a few interesting guest stars such as John Lovitz as Cheapo and Mark Hamil as the plastic surgion who hates models Also Tom Kenny SpongeBob was on the show as the owner of the strip club in most every episode Stan Lee has a cameo in one episode tooThe Breakdown PROS Had a great look to it at first FUNNY AS HELL a very fun show great voice talent for the most part Chief Strogenoff watch the show and see some of the stuff he does and was easily the best of the three animated shows mentioned earlierCONS The midseries animation change and the crappy DVD described earlier Aside from the fact that some of the humor could be kind of dumb at times I have nothing really negative to say about thisOVERALL Stripperella is a huge guilty pleasure of mine and its a shame it only ran one season It was a very funny sexy actioned packed cult series that I hope to see air on Adult Swim someday with the original intro intact and possibly give it another season like Family Guy Check it out even if it is on the lousy DVD You will laugh yourself sillyRated TVMA Crude and Sexual Humor and Nudity Runtime About 25 minutes per episode Score 910,1

When a Stranger Calls belongs to the group of this years remakes with movies like Poseidon just over the horizon Director Simon West Con Air helms this updated version with plenty of relative unknown casts which signals either the death rate is high it isnt or that established stars are steering clear from a potential turkeyClocking in at a relatively short 87 minutes its primarily made up of two acts The first which takes a full one hour is the setup Our heroine Jill Johnson Camilla Belle chalked up 800 minutes of talk time on her mobile phone do the math and as a lesson in responsibility her parents had confiscated her mobile and grounded her To pay off her debt she works part time as a babysitter and looking after the wealthy Mandrakis kids is her first stintThe huge Mandrakis mansion gets a full tour treatment as it is where all the action will take place Plenty of rooms makes for good hiding an indoor pool sized aquariumpond to get wet in for the wet Tshirt treatment and check this out motion detector lights which you just know will contribute to the scares with the manipulation of lights and shadows Naturally prank calls red herrings are aplenty which chalks up this acts runtime but most of them fall flat in the suspense departmentTheres a minor trend emerging with actors being the unseen providing and acting through their voice instead Recent attempts include Edward Norton in Kingdom of Heaven and Hugo Weavings V for Vendetta Here Lance Henriksen does the honours for the anonymous nameless psychotic killer but it just falls flat Why The script doesnt give him much dialogue Most of the phone calls made were of the silent mindmasturbatory nature which I felt was a waste they could have also casted some unknown instead and the job will still get doneThe second act where the main action takes place is too little too late And the bogeyman well is purely a bogeyman Those expecting blood and gore will be disappointed as basically its a one woman show to hold your attention in the first hour eye candies always succeed and this act will have her resolve everything in double quick time ala Rachel McAdams in Red Eye Dont expect any form of character development nor subplots that will engageThe ending tried to be too smart for its own good and came across as a cheap way to end the movie Theres not much of goodness to highlight from this movie no scares no thrills no enigmatic villain and plenty of security flaws especially with that door alarm the only thing its good for is to provide a number for 4D,0
Years ago with Ray of Light Madonna broke through to a truly amazing level of musical artistry and since then shes occasionally transcended even her own standards This concert production with its hypnotic editing amazing dancing hallucinatory lighting effects and tranceinducing arrangements blows away all previous efforts Madonnas apparent ambition to singlehandedly bring about world peace through music and dance may seem hubristic or absurd to some But hell somebodys got to do it Thanks to her assemblage of the remarkable talent of everyone involved in this production Confessions Tour Live from London places her once again among the top ten artists working anywhere in the world in any medium,1
We start all of our reviews with the following information My wife and I have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years Recently we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost So we can see whatever we want whenever we want The point of this is that CRITICS count for ZERO Your local critics or the national critics like Ebert are really no different than you or me The only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or notTherefore it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us We NEVER EVER listen or read the critics We only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us Well enough about thatThis movie is very good not just good but very good The critics are a bunch of morons Just because there is nudity and language they hated it It was worth the price of ticket and that is all you can ask for Is that not right Every movie cannot be an academy award nominee Sharon stone is gorgeous and does a great job in the movie and it mystifies me as to what in the hell the critics want,1
Very stark very drab no real drama Why not just make a documentary This isnt exactly The Passion of Joan of Arc The only reason for seeing Chronicles is to hear the performances I love Bachs music and even I found it hard to sit through this misery of a film The great Gustav Leonhardt plays in two senses of the word Bach We dont get much of a sense of him as an actor since hes given so little to do dramatically Mostly he gets to walk purposefully or angrily out of various rooms Bachs life of course was not an Errol Flynn movie It was indeed fairly drab and more than a little hard This probably means that the life isnt a terrific candidate for a film The music of course is another story I recommend The Stations of Bach Far more information for one thing and some insight into the music which is after all why Bach interests us in the first place,0
Why do they keep making trash like this because it makes money thats why Eraser is not so much a film but a string of action set pieces strung together Its well filmed but predictable and its all been done before only better This is basically a Nineties version of Commando,0
Who could have thought a nondisabled actor could act so realistically and immensely powerfully as a disabled person in a film Probably someone But noone truly noone could ever compare their expectations with the amazingly emotive and powerful performance given by the two actors in this filmMichael Steven Robertson lives in a home for disabled people He has Cerebral Paulsy and as shown to us right at the beginning he has huge trouble communicating So it truly is a lifeline when fellow disabled member Rory James McAvoy who can speak normally understands him Thus starts off a friendship that relies mainly on ironically enough communicationIn a hilarious scene they manage to move out of the home into their own After Rory had been rejected good hearted Michael put forward an application to move into his own house Rory who already had a bad name with the judges was to be his interpreterBut troubles soon come about They begin goodheartedly stalking a girl who they met in a pub a while back wanting her to be their assistant to do the little things that matter She at first is reluctant she does not know these men but seems they could be harmless so strikes up another friendship but not necessarily a good oneAs well as being poignant however this film really does rely on the actors But that isnt a bad thing For a non disabled actor you see Rory though he can communicate properly frustrated at the way hes completely dependant on other people and has no real life of his own But the real star for me is Steven Robertson He acts with such emotion yearning to fit in and sadnesshappiness that really sees him win over the whole entire filmExcellentOverall 5 out of 5,1
I went to the cinema in 1973 when the film was released I was 11 at the time I remember how much I enjoyed it and wanted to live in Shangrila thats how naive and young I was I recently came across a video of the film I had recorded off television some years ago I watched it again and am not ashamed to admit I still enjoy it as much now as I did 29 years ago I also enjoy listening to the words of the songs because it makes me think that one day we could live in a place where the sound of guns dont pound in our ears and if we look at our reflection we should be happy with what we see This is what I call a feel good film because I feel happy after watching it Maybe I am still naive but it makes me happy and Im sure it will make you happy if you watch it with an open mind and enjoy it for what it is a good family film I must be one of the few people who has this film on VHS PAL video and DVD selfmade I recorded it on DVD as the videotape recording from TV was starting to wear thin I still watch it from time to time,1
haha you have to just smile and smile if you actually made it all the way through this movie it like says something about myself i guess the movie itself was created i think as some sort of psychological test or like some sort of drug to take you to a place you have never been before When Wittgenstein wrote his famous first philosophical piece the tractacus sp he said it was meaningless and useless but if you read it after you were done it would take you to a new level like a ladder and then you could throw away the work and see things with clarity and true understanding this movie is the same i thinkAs a movie it is without a doubt the worst movie i have seen in a long long time in such a unique way first of all this is snipes i loved watching this guy kick ass in various movies and i have suffered through a few weak ones however although you know the movie might suck you would never suspect that it could be as bad as it actually was which is the fun of it i mean this is snipes you know it might be good but it will be alright right smileso this thing on every level is pure boredom pure unoriginality the reference to the professional is both dead on and obvious yet so poorly done as to be comical there is not one character in this movie that is interesting in the least and to make the whole thing more surreal they have a soundtrack that sort of sounds like parts to various Bourne identity type movies only isnt quite right in fact although it seems close to action movie background music it just so happens it is done in a manner that will grate on you fantasticallythen all the scenes in the total pitch black where honestly since the characters are so flat you dont really care whats going to happen but regardless after it happens and someone is killed you just say to yourself was i supposed to see that what else how about scenes with blinding obnoxious flashing at a strobe lights pace for a period of time that is too long to bear sure lets throw that in how bout this though when you are straining and your eyes cant handle it any longer do some more of these in the dark kills where you really dont see what happened and on top of that lets face it you dont care you were past bored way from the beginningso i drifted in and out a couple times but i caught almost all of this movie and it becomes something you can watch without something that engages your mind on any level therefore it becomes something you can effectively zone out with and begin to think about your life where its going where its been what we are as peopleand that that is the true magic of this film,0
Look Im sorry if half the world takes offense at this but life is confusing enough I dont need to watch it that way I dig Anthony Hopkins big time I even watched Fracture and I knew that would be a steaming pile of Quentin But this thing is not well shot and its not daringeven if it is artsy Wellproduced films have reasons for cuts and fast edits not this oh but its a realistic interpretation excuse This thingll make your head hurt Its the fastest moving picture ever to take you nowhere at all I still love AH and Ill always give him another chance but if you arent made of time to watch bad ideas on screen skip this,0
Being a person who does not usually enjoy boxing movies feeling they only focus on the boxing and not the characters themselves this movie truly moved me I loved being able to see the main character DianaMichelle Rodriguez go through so many things in such a short while it was amazing to me Michelle Rodriguez did such a wonderful job playing Diana especially since this was her first acting experience she showed true emotion and portrayed Diana wonderfully All actors had chemistry on screen and made this movie even more amazing I highly recommend this movie even to those who do not usually watch boxing movies 1010,1
Not one of the better pokemon moviesTwo legendary pokemon come into the story You do get to see how strong Celebi can be though he turns evil firstSuicune also makes an appearance he didnt seem that powerfulThe Marauder didnt have many strong pokemon at all except for that taranitar Some fight scenes with his pokemon may have made it betterAsh and Pikachu meet the much younger Professor Oak though they dont realise it Misty I was thinking had it at the end but she didnt get close I saw this in the creditsDont expect much here the worst of the series so far,0
I am a Motion Picture Production major at Wright State University in Ohio and yesterday I was sadly given the opportunity to watch this godawful film in class We were informed by our professor that it would be very funny to us but the reason we were watching it was because it was one of the first sound films a complete disasterThe problem with early sound films was that Hollywood actors only knew how to do silent movies and they werent good at memorizing lines So producers and directors would look to the stage to get actors Sounds like a great idea right Well the kind of acting one does on stage doesnt show up too well on film Most of the actors in Atlantic look and sound like theyre acting in a play which results in lots of hearty laughs at the overacting Another limitation of early sound film was the technology of microphones You couldnt move the mikes like you can today you had to keep them static or it would pick up the sound of air moving through There was usually one mike used in any given scene in this movie In one particular scene there is a man sitting at a table Someone walks right up to him and delivers their line then walks away Another actor comes up from behind him delivers their line then walks away It goes on like this for a couple more people The microphone is obviously right by the man at the table making for a laughable actor carouselThose are only technical problems If you get into the story and direction then it gets even worse The story is a fictionalized account of what happened on the Titanic The characters are unbelievable and pointless A story about a man cheating on his wife and their teenage daughter has no place in the movie It is barely resolved and leaves you wondering why it was there in the first place A lousy attempt at high drama the actors take long pregnant pauses between lines many times It is tiresome and you cant wait for this 90 minute feels like 180 at least movie to get over with Im not going to talk a whole lot about the issue of racism at this time in our country but it really offended me that there were only two blacks in the whole movie and they were portrayed as animals They both pushed past the women and children to try and get in one of the lifeboats They were ordered to stop or be shot and of course they didnt so they were shot I was appalledI give this movie a 210 I would have given it a 110 the lowest rating possible but I gave it an extra point just because it was one of the first sound films and I tried to put it into context If you want to see a good early sound film check out Alfred Hitchcocks Blackmail that also came out in the year 1929 You will find that the best directors were able to adapt to new technology immediately,0
The Wicker Man I am so angry that I cannot write a proper comment about this movieThe plot was ridiculous thinly tied together and altogetherjust lame Nicolas Cageshame on you I assumed that since you were in it that it would be at least decent It was notI felt like huge parts of the movie had been left on the cutting room floor and even if its completethe movie was just outlandish and sillyAt the end youre left mouth agape mind befuddled and good taste offended I have never heard so many people leave a theater on opening day with so much hatred People were complaining about it in small groups in the mall four floors down from the theater near the entrance Its that badI heard it compared to Glitter American Werewolf in Paris and Gigli My boyfriend was so mad he wouldnt even talk about itGrrrr,0
The positives Its shot pretty well Has some interesting peripheral characters Likable main character albeit weakThe bad Plotstory Editing Characters wasted Jessica AlbaIm a fan of sappy movies but this movie is cringeinducingly bad I dont understand how anyone can hand over 12M to this Guy Jenkin And before I go any further I just want to say that I dont dislike Jessica AlbaI really wanted to like her in this film However Jessica Alba in her fake accent and her model poses made me miserable She has absolutely no screen presence in this movie and she ruins every scene shes in Needless to say the romance does not come off as believablenot even a tiny bitAll I saw throughout was the actors flapping their wings trying to get this thing off the ground with what little they were givenbut sadly all this movie does is sink There is no emotional connection no emotional conflict and nothing is gained Its a pretty empty movie,0
I saw that The Foreigner was ranked in the Bottom 100 movie listings here on IMDb so I wasnt expecting much when I tuned into it on the USA channel a week back but I did have hopes Belly Of The Beast which aired a month ago was a mess but it had great scenery and photography and some pretty cool moments scattered throughout so I thought that this movie might have some of the same Alas this movie fails the standards of basic watchability in almost every way The screenplay comes off as the bastard offspring of a John LeCarre novel and a Richard Ludlum movie but done by people with none of those worthy writers talent for plot and characterization Instead what we got is a glum meanspirited nihilistic cryptic mares nest of muddled motives tangled alliances and backshootings And chest shootings And bombings And eviscerations This carries over to the directorial style which relies on hackneyed grainy shotslow motion shots every 10 seconds along with wire work and hyperactive jump cuts These filmic devices that were stale 10 years ago when MTV directors used them for Whitesnake videos and the director works them like a punch press hoping to inject some weird arthouse techno thriller coolness into the proceedings Segal himself is just awful in this He spends the entire film talking in a hoarse throaty halfwhisper and alternating between two expressions looking like he is sucking on a lemon while someone waves a small turd under his nose or looking constipated And hes so chunky and vain about it that he never actually takes off his knee length duster on camera I understand that its hard to keep the girth under control as a male actor ages although Denzel Washington and Paul Newman never seemed to have that problem But you deal with it by being honest about it and by growing as an actor not by hiding it with carefully chosen camera angles and floor length robes So I cant really tell whats going on and the movie doesnt give me a reason to care about whats going on and the protagonist is completely one dimensional and visually unappealing Not a recipe for a good movie experience Oddly most of the set designs and scenery are atmospheric and striking in fact if you were to freeze the film on almost any given scene that wasnt a closeup of Seagal you would be struck by the care and professionalism of the lightingcolors and composition and by how beautiful the Eastern European settings are But dressing up a rotten egg as a Faberge egg cant make it edible And the proceedings are rotten at heart There are cool movies like Versus and there are visually striking but emotionally cold movies like Underworld and there are paranoia conspiracy thrillers like The Bourne Identity and its remake with Matt Damon And then there is this thing which cant make up its mind what it wants to be pretends to be all these things and fails because it has no guts or soul This is a movie made by professionals with an actual budget so you cant really put it in the same class as Manos Killer Shrews or Hobgoblins But Id rather watch all three of those movies backtoback several times than watch The Foreigner again even once,0
This is te cartoon that should have won instead of Country Cousin Visually welldone and much more entertaining and memorable Worth watching just for the music alone Although there are elements that undoubtably will bruise the sensibilities of some these days the cartoon has to be given a bit of perspective Its over sixty years old and it is after all just a cartoon Im disabled and if I were as hypersensitive as the folks who look at things like this cartoon and take umbrage I would have long since curled up in a fetal position and faded away Sometimes you need to lighten up put your head back and float Caricatures of celebrities in cartoons were common in the 1930s and 1940s and were almost never terribly flattering Bing Crosby reportedly hated it when he was used on more than one occasion SIGH,1
Movies about dinosaurs can be entertaining So can Whoopi Goldberg movies But Whoopi AND dinosaursAfter the first 20 minutes of Theodore Rex I had come to one conclusion this movie is evil Evil vile wicked and reprehensible in its spite for the audience Nothing this bad is made by accident this is the visual equivalent of a torture chamberFirst of all Whoopi does not make good action movies watch Fatal Beauty if you think Im lying but the film makers dont care shes a tough cop here yet again Seen a million cop buddy flicks this week Well heres number one million and one palDont like cute humanistic animated dinosaurs since that Spielberg TV show about them Too bad heres another one and hes a cop tooYou one of those people that hates car chases shootouts sloppy dialogue boring futuristic FX and seeing talented people Goldberg MuellerStahl Roundtree stuck in a movie that looks like a tax writeoff A BIG tax writeoffAnd you read this review all the way to the end You DESERVE a sequel SeriouslyNo stars not a one And if they really make a sequel to Theodore Rex Hollywood deserves to be attacked a whole herd of wisecracking foam rubber dinosaursNow Id pay to see that,0
The best way to have fun in this movie is to count how many clichs it is rehashing Snarling Chinese gangsters A female vicepresident A ventilator duct that happens to be big enough to fit a big Caucasian male Shooting through the wall to kill the bad guy A Situation where you need to snuff out some innocent people to prevent Armageddon Independence Day scenes where you snuff out some memorable landmarks in a fireball The vice president in a nice well lighted room surrounded by subordinates while the Chinese premier virtually alone in a dark room with just bit of dim light shining snarling as viciously as the slimy gangsters A lone hero left alone in a ship building airplane whatever wreaking havoc on clueless bad guys with big automatic weapons Etc etc etcThe second best way is to count how many zeroes you need to put after the decimal to accurately gauge the probability of the film scenario I counted up to 45 A president agreeing to a meeting on board a private vessel The impossibly nonoverridable command from the nuke box The part where the Chinese decided to play shoot em up Etc etc Man the earth is more likely fall into the sun than for this film to happen I admit the film was interesting until the point the evil Taiwanese gangsters kidnapped the President Then the boredom kicked in Suspension of disbelief ceased and I started thinking the fun Id have torturing this film,0
This movie seemed like it was going to be better than it ended up being The cinematography is good the acting seemed solid the dialogue wasnt too stiff but then about twenty minutes in theres this long scene with a Doctor who you know is actually a patient at the asylum pretending to be a Doctor and it just goes south from thereOn top of that the demon is about the silliest looking hellspawn since the Godzillalooking thing in Curse of the Demon Theres also some odd demon worshippers who wear masks that look like the exploding teens from the beginning of Logans RunIn the end the cinematography couldnt save this movie Despite some pretty solid performances by the actors the story just doesnt go anywhere I think Hellbored would have been a better title for this,0
It purports to be the life of Paul the apostle It opens with him involved in a loincloth wrestling match with a priest The Pharisees were called that because they separated themselves from the Hellenism being forced upon the Jews by their Gentile rulers The point is that Saul would never have been involved in GrecoRoman wrestling PERIODThen we have the two men Saul and the Priest Reuben a totally extrabiblical fictitious character shown being washed down in the nude in a Roman style bath house Again the Torah which Saul adhered to religiously condemned in the strongest possible terms looking upon the nakedness of another manReuben is shown being the one that pushes Saul into destroying the church Again the text of scripture doesnt matter for their it is PAUL that says that he laid waste of the church and breathed out threatenings and slaughter against the churchThe movie shows Barnabas sprinkling Paul not baptizing immersing him when the Text of Scripture says it was Ananias that did itTheir is no mention of Mark or his turning back so the writers of the script are forced to have Paul and Barnabas argue over Pauls desire to preach in Rome as the basis of their separationNo Silas on Pauls Second and Third Missions No Timothy EVER No Titus No Apollos No NO NOOOO James is said to have known Jesus for a long time rather than it saying as the Text of Scripture does that he is Jesus brotherWhy not just call the movie Frank the fictitious Apostle At least that would be closer to the text of scripture,0
The Hills Have Eyes II is what you would expect it to be and nothing more Of course its not going to be an Oscar nominated film its just pure entertainment which you can just lose yourself in for 90 minutesThe plot is basically about a group of National Guard trainees who find themselves battling against the notorious mutated hillbillies on their last day of training in the desert Its just them fighting back throughout the whole film which includes a lot of violence which is basically the whole film as blood and guts are constantly flying around throughout the whole thing and also yet another graphic rape scene which is pointlessly thrown in to shock the audienceId give the Hills Have Eyes II 4 out of 10 for pure entertainment and that only Although even then I found myself looking at my watch more and more as the film went on as it began to drag due to the fact it continued to try and shock the audience with graphic gore and the occasional jump scene just to make sure the audience stays awake The Hills Have Eyes II is just decent entertainment something to pass time if youre bored and nothing else410,0
The box to this movie totally misrepresents itself The cover shows a view of legs panties in a short skirt The title is Tart The synopsis on the back of the box made it seem as though Cat the main character was an outcast who became one of the popular students but that popularity lead to a bizarre lifestyle that she could not escape from Everything that the box built this movie up to was a horrible lie I expected a sort of crappy directtovideo version of Heathers targeted at the teenagers of todayLet me tell you what Tart was really about Yes this really is the plot so if you dont want to know what happens stop reading We have one unlikable boring rich girl This unlikable girls best friend is a skank The skank gets expelled from school so the unlikable girl befriends some British girl This leads to the unlikable girl dating this boring guy who the box refers to as the most popular boy in school If that guy was the most popular guy in their school I wish I would have gone to that high school because I could have kicked the crap out of him Anyway as any movie will tell you the most popular guy in school is invariably a murderer or drug addict or thief or in this case all of the above Anyway everyone ends up disliking the unlikable main character because she is Jewish Then the most popular guy in school beats her best friend the skank to death with a rock because the skank caught the most popular boy in a homosexual act The unlikable girls stoic mother and hypochondriac younger brother are there for her at the end Oh and the entire movie is about snotty rich kids and their horrible parents too Gee what is wrong with that That sounds like a fantastic movie Well thats what I thought But you see there are NO likeable characters in this movie The main character is boring The filmmakers made her average while during the film she keeps spouting off about what a freak she is The skank is not skanky enough and has little screen time The popular guy is nothing to write home about The popular girls are just your runofthemill rich girls There are no moral lessons Cat the boring main character is not a freak does not ever become one of the truly popular girls and worst of all after all the crap she goes through she thinks she is still too good to befriend the only nice girl the dorky girl To be honest I have no idea why the movie is called Tart I kept asking whos the tart Is she the tart Are they all tarts At 94 minutes theoretically this is not a long movie But after actually watching this awful waste of a VHS tape and not knowing who the tart was I was surprised that the movie was only an hour and a half The movie felt like it was two hours and some change After a while I was hoping the movie would be about pop tarts At least when you look at a box of pop tarts you know what to expect,0
This is actually a trilogy of 3 of Somerset Maughams short tales The first one is The Verger which is about 15 minutes long and very enjoyable After 17 years Albert Foreman is laid off from his church job because he cant read nor write So what does he do Opens a tobacco shop of courseThe second is Mr KnowAll which was actually a story I had read for school 6 years ago and instantly forgotten until I heard the familiar introduction Another 15 minute one and also very good It worked better on film than in a book for me but then perhaps thats because I was only 14 the last time afterallThe 3rd one is nearly a letdown Almost an hour in length it simply drags Its not all that bad but not as quick and snappy as the last 2 I watched the first quarter hour of it and then skipped forward to the last quarter hour and found that it still made sense and really I hadnt missed a thingOverall I give them 8 9 and 6 out of 10 respectively,1
When my wife and I decided to watch this movie we thought it couldnt fail I love Billy Crystal my wife loves Julia Roberts and everyone we talked to said they loved itWe were misled in spadesOn my part I felt Billy Crystals character was extremely onedimensional and did very little for the film Sure he cracked a couple of good jokes but as a character he did nothing but take up spaceAnd poor Julia Roberts In past shows she plays well as a strongwilled selfdetermined lady In this flick she seems completely repressed and had very little fire This is not the Julia Roberts that my wife enjoys watchingOK if I were to find one good thing it would have to be Christopher Walken Now thats entertainment But just like Billy Crystal hardly anything is shown of his characterIf youre looking for a night of mindless laughs with very little redeeming value go see it But if youre looking for a smart romantic comedy this is not your film Its none of the above,0
I consider myself lucky that I got to view a wonderful movie with two marvelous actors Kramer vs Kramer was great to me because I think I could relate to itUnfortunately my parents are divorced Even though I was older than Billy in this movie I felt his pain and confusion Having two parents who you thought were happy and end up hating each other is the worst Through this movie actually I think it made me realize that my parents are people too and they had as just much pain as my sister and I hadBack to the movie this was a good one Yes its dated and Meryl and Dustin are very young But I would recommend this for a lot of people because I think most can relate in some way There are funny sad happy and relieving moments that are carried away terrificly by these great actors Its a good movie and deserves more credit than a 75910,1
One of the worst things a film studio can do is exploit the tragedies of others commercializing a shock or gore factor in order to sell tickets to be able to buy their Birch a new diamond necklace Another worst thing is to totally misrepresent the true facts of an incredible saga by fabricating events dialog and images to the directors own liking Lastly one of the worst things a film studio can do is to use bottomofthebarrel actors and shoot it all on a sound stage that was rented for fifty cents a day All three of these travesties the makers of this film are guilty of This is handsdown the worst movie I have ever seen and Ive seen thousands A score of 1 is too good for this waste of celluloid Not only should the filmmakers be ashamed for making it they should be ashamed for negatively exploiting the heroes of this story which are the people who experienced this tragedy firsthand both the living and the dead,0
This is a movie that has a lot of things that only Japanese people can understand Even well translated there are some things that are obviously private jokes or regional symbolism My guess is that it tried to send a message of some sort but that just got wasted on meWhat I felt that is basically this is a mediocre movie with nice special effects Some kid becomes The one and in the end has almost no relevance to a yokai war that makes no sense whatsoever anyway It would have been nice to understand what the hell they were talking about but between the Azumi bean washing yokai and the one that looks like a big tongued umbrella Rihanna eat your heart out I couldnt really discern the plotBottom line nice visuals the kid screams a lot the river princess is terrible cute and the rest is crap,1
